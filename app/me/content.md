I currently work at [InkLink](https://www.inklink.com/). We are trying to bridge the trust gap in the new world.

On a broader note, I am interested in _distributed computing_ and how it can be used to speed up processing in databases. I am also deeply invested in _system design_ and how each small component build up the world around us.

I recently graduated with a BS in Computer Science from [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/) in June 2023. Now, I am doing my MS in Data Science at [USF](https://www.usfca.edu/).

Previously, I worked at [MoneyLion](https://moneylion.com/).
