it's been a long time since i hung out with my closest college friends after we all left for different parts of the country for the job. A is back in the city for a outside land concert and he's crashing on my couch tonight. J, N, A and I decided to get dinner and J suggested house of prime ribs (HOPR) since A and myself hadn't had it before

we arrived at 9.30pm (the 2nd last seating available) and the place is packed like sardin. we got house of prime ribs each (the other had not 2nd serving available). i didn't expect the meat is to be so thick and huge. it's drenched in sauce and was tender yet chewy.
J gave each of us a blind box of labubu and I got a black cat! it's now sitting on my table watching me. we talked, joked around but overall it's such a fun time - away from work and all the boredom at night. we all finished our first and 2nd slice was a very thin slice of meat ðŸ¥², we all thought we are getting the first serving thickness.
ended with a keylime cheesecake

it's 11.30pm - we are the last few people there. we chilled at my place till around 1am - just continuing catching up and talking; uniqlo boys, finger feet, labubus, joint bones, work etc

so grateful to have friends that are like minded and make myself feel happy being around

p.s tips I learned from N for HOPR: you don't need to finish to the bone to get 2nd serving, instead cut around the bone area and leave some meat on there. you can then get it to go
