Some people say I am really lucky to get a job out of school in a top tier place like [MoneyLion](https://www.moneylion.com/).

I think it would selling myself too short to say that all of this is due to pure luck because I did so much work for it. Well luck plays a part, but I also think I worked the idea of creating my own luck or to expand your [luck surface area](https://weichuntan.com/blog/luck).

I remember I used to have this mindset where if I take all of these classes, aim for a 4.0 GPA, take this internship, do these side projects, then I am guaranteed X outcome. But that was also a time where I caught myself burning out and stressing out. I was aiming much higher, going into places like FAANGs, but I was also getting rejected left and right.

Then I came to think about another mode of living where you could just do the work and let the outcome be the outcome. I think that's where I am now. I can't control everything, but what I can do is just try my best to put myself out there. Along the way, I also try to be grateful and excited about any small wins that come my way because that's another step forward.

You can put it so many hours and it will not work out in the end, but that's okay. Remember, you are not entitled to it.

You just have to keep your heads down, and continue on. [As you persist, the outcome will come](https://weichuntan.com/blog/be-patient-about-success).
