Have you ever noticed that Google searches these days are filled with click bait titles and advertisement to sell you something? 

I feel that the amount of good articles or resources that are searchable had gone down significantly and most of the existing one are written for monetization, leaving behind the good ones in the dark.

It came to a point when I start ending my google searches with "Reddit" so that I can get more unfiltered raw opinions on a subject matter. Since Reddit is harder to monetize, you can get better resource over there which were not worded for SEO purposes.
