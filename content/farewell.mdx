I celebrated one of my colleagues departure today. It was a bittersweet moment, as I was happy for him to move on to a new chapter in him life, but also sad that we didn't collaborate as much.

Before he left, I managed catch up with him to learn about his plans and his thoughts on his departure. His reasons are pure simple: he wants to be challenged further, to explore new things and to continue learning. Although MoneyLion has been a great place of growth, he felt that he has reached a plateau and it was time to move on.

I am glad he noticed that very early on.

Sometime, people took too long to notice that they reached a plateau, where their growth rate jas slowed down or stagnates. Well, you may be the best in people's eyes but you are not the best in your own eyes. Life is not exciting if you are not always putting yourself in uncomfortable situation, where you are a beginner again.

It's nice to hear compliments about the things you are doing, but is that the only things you crave on other people?

We went to Tap Tap to celebrate his departure. It was raining so heavily and we are all soaked even with umbrellas, but it was a good time. We talked about everything under the sky, from work to personal life, share some tea about things we are working on, and also some gossips.

After Tap Tap, we continued on walking around Bukit Bintang, which is filled with the hustle and bustle of KL's night life. There's a night market filled with tourist, barbecue and drinks store on my left and right, a busker singing at the corner, people attracting other to dine in their restaurant.

We ended the night at Halab, drinking my all time favourite Adani tea.

It was a good night, albeit an exhausting one from the walks we had. I gained new friends and I am glad to have met them.

If you are reading this, see you at work and let's catch up more!
