There is a growing number of people who don't have the necessary credit history to obtain a loan from a bank. This is particularly true for individuals from underprivileged backgrounds or those without a steady income stream.

Life is unpredictable, and there are times when people need to borrow money to navigate through a rough patch. For instance, $100 might determine whether someone can afford groceries for their family's dinner. Compared to the high-interest rates charged by B2C loan servicing platforms like [LendingClub](https://www.lendingclub.com/) and [Prosper](https://www.prosper.com/), a peer-to-peer lending platform can offer much lower rates and lower minimums for borrowers.

There are multiple platforms that does this in the US. But the most famous one would be [SoloFunds](https://solofunds.com/). I think this is great but if you look into Reddit, there are a defaults that are not being paid back. And the incentives for the lender is not really clear.

Some of the key things that I think would be important for a peer to peer lending platform which future platform could do better:

- Incentives for the lender to lend money - High interest rate with appropriate risk, quick returns
- Incentives for the borrower to pay back the loan - Flexible repayment schedules, higher limit for future loans, (blacklisting)
- How to detect potential fraud and scams
- Ranking system to match suitable lenders and borrowers
- An intelligent way to collect money from the borrower if they default - For example, look into borrower's bank account history to determine when is the best time to collect money
- Platform sustainability
- Better UI/UX - no more clunky 2000s website / apps

The potential market includes underdeveloped countries where access to credit cards and banks is limited. This represents a significant opportunity to aid those in need.

If anyone is willing to pick this up, let's talk and we can work something out.
