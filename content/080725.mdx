i learned a new game today called splendor! it's a korean pokemon card game where you collect disc (coins) to purchase pokemon or upgrade them. the first to reach 18 points or more (in case of a tie) wins
18 points sounds easy to achieve but the game took more than an hour

top left of pokemon card shows points, top right is the discount you could get on future pokemon purchase, bottom left is how many pokeballs you need to purchase.
each turn, you either collect pokeballs (take 3 different colored or 2 same colored), reserve a pokemon (take a card and 1 masterball to be purchase in the future) or buy a pokemon.
you could also evolve one of your pokemon each turn.

thought it was a simple game but there's a lot to calculate because each turn i have to decide what to buy and in turn with that pokemon discount, what can i redeem for free now (giving you an advantage)

overall it's a very fun game and glad that i joined
