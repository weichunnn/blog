Didn't get out of the house today and acted like a hermit. Stayed shelled in the house.

Some people find it difficult to be alone, thinking that you should always go out, meet someone, do something - but I think the contrarian view is fine too. It's okay to be in a shell.

For the first time in a while, I cooked my own breakfast. I made a toast with sunny side up eggs and sauteed mushrooms. I wanted to make a whole sandwich but I was missing lettuces and tomatoes. Maybe next time.

I learned how to make a sunny side from my dad. He taught me the secret: to cook it on low heat and with a wooden spoon, spread oil on top of the egg yolk. This makes the egg white crispy while at the same time, cook the yolk slightly so that it's not too runny. You should get a perfect egg in ~2 minutes.

Pair that with coffee and I had a perfect breakfast.

I spent the rest of the day studying - looking into leetcode and trying to understand Snowflake's architecture. I think I am still on track to finish my prep by mid Feb, which is when I will start applying for jobs. I installed a new [pomodoro timer](https://www.flow.app/) today to help me focus, and I love using it so far. It's simple and clean.

For dinner, I air-fried cod with paprika and garlic powder. It wasn't as good as I expected from the recipe. I think cod is better when steamed. Lesson learned.
