talked to someone on the team who is leaving soon. he will be working on QA for robotics and I think that's such a cool idea.

there's a big pulling factor compared to software when you are able to interact with the things you are working with in real life.
imagine tinkering with parts and connecting new hardware to make sure the computing is faster. that's the wonder of working with hardware.

working behind the scene in infrastructure might be boring for some poeple because you don't really touch the product often. you build system that power another person
that actually build the product. so more burn out tends to happen here.
