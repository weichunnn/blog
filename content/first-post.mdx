Putting yourself out there is important. It lets people know who you are and maybe from there you get to collaborate with others. 

I think that was why I started to write and more recently on [Medium](https://blog.det.life/roadmap-to-learn-data-engineering-how-i-would-start-again-02b115d8cebe). I hope to be able to churn out 1 post a week. 

With [quantity comes quality](https://jsomers.net/blog/speed-matters). So just start writing.
