I made a bet in applying to graduate school in the US. It was always my dream to go over there, take part in university, travel, experience the culture where tech is booming. I was so excited to start a new chapter in my life. But another part of me is always worried about the future.

People I talk to always say worrying is bad for health and to just ignore. But on the hand hand, I feel that worrying pushes me to think of the future and plan ahead. As long as it is no exaggerated, I think it's okay to worry a little.

Now that I write these things down, I can be more aware of it and try to find a solution to them. To how can I best prepare myself for the future. 

I want to set myself up with ambitious goals so I can work towards them. I want to be able to look back and say, "I did it." But, I also want to be aware that it's okay to slow down and take a break when I need to. To experience life as it is.

p.s this is more of a personal note to myself. I'm not sure if it's a good idea to publish this. But I will just do it to share my thoughts.
