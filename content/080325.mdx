went back to CT today to visit a place I frequent on Waverly St. the corner store has a bunch of cute and artsy things and right in the middle, is a 3rd floor temple. today, it's quiet but sometimes there is a group of tourist in it. the aunty gave me some sweets and a red packet with tea.

i wanted to get roasted pork because there's a place which is famouse for it - kam po on broadway. ended up not get it because the store wanted a minimum of $20 worth and i only want half of it

lunchtime: cooked eggplant with minced pork for lunch with leftover soup. for some reason, eggplants are such a simple yet tasty meal. i did canto style today but the next one will be japanese: nasu dengaku. first time i had it was at echigo

ended the night with some work before monday starts again
