tl;dr default to no, unless it's a hell yes. 

For the past couple of months, I am fortunate enough to always have something going on or something I want to do. But a lot of those ideas always lingers around in my mind because time is not on my side and I cannot act on them. 

I realize that I live a life where I **defaulted to yes** on whatever ideas/events when they come my way. I say yes to all sort of things because it's something I never done or it's something that I might enjoy. 

This consequently robs me of the time to do the things that I really want to do.

Now, before I say yes to anything, I ask myself, "[Is this a hell yes or nah?" If it's not a hell yes, then it's a nah](https://sive.rs/hyn). Instead of doing the 99% of things that clutter your life, focus on the 1% that really matters.
