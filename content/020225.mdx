One of my fear of being abroad is losing that friendship and connection with friends from high school. We share so many shared memories and experiences that being with them felt like home.

Every once in a while, I call my friend and we talk for hours. We talk about everything and anything. Me updating him on what I did, them updating me on what happened to them + other friends.

I feel appreciative that I have friends that I can call and talk to even when I'm abroad. They keep me realistic and help me see things from a different perspective. They give me the condidence to try things and even if I fail, I know that they will be there to support me.

Thanks for being there for me.

I hope you have friends like that too.

❤️
