People sometimes ask me how do I always have a topic to write about (and time to write, but this is a different topic). The truth is, I don't always have a topic to write about. Some days, I just sit down and write about something that I read; some days, I write about something that I experiences or crossed my mind; while some days, I sit down to pounder of 2 hours to come up with a topic to write about.

For me, the key is **to just write**. It **doesn't matter if it's good or bad**, as long as I write something. I admit that sometimes life gets in the way, so I didn't complete my goal for that day, but I will be back the next day to write again.

One thing that worked for me is to read more, no matter what topic it is - to expand my reach of the world. I also like to read about other people's life, to see how they live and what they think about. It's a good way to get inspiration.

Another way is to practice abstract thinking. I find that simple things have a lot of intricacies behind it if you don't take things at face value. Link that theory and apply it to another theory. And to do this, you definitely need to read more which relates to the point above. Huberman has a [good podcast episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPlJcD-o-4Q) on this.
