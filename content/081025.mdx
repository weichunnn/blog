2 weeks ago, i picked up 4 keyboards for $5 on facebook marketplace. i thought it was worth flipping since it's only 2 blocks down and the price is very cheap.
there's 2 mechanical keyboard and 2 older style keyboards. turns out, it's harder than expected. somebody wanted to pick up today but didn't in the end because it's not the switch they want.

in the evening, i used the e scooter for the first time myself. it's so fun. i used spin instead of lime because they gave you 8 rides under 5 minutes for free.
it's a little bumpy and scary when i need to watch out for holes on the road.

i woke up with a sharp pain on my elbow area. i think a splash of oil got to me from cooking yesterday. there's a small pus that grew near my elbow ðŸ˜”
