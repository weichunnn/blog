I am back writing on my blog after a hiatus 6 months ago - when I reached SF. It's a little of both being busy and lazy that I find myself not writing anymore.

I missed it.

Despite how smart the human brain is, we still forget things. If you asked me what happened on this day 1 year ago, I probably need to search your calendar or social media to find out.

Memory is finite. I want to remember things.

So I will start with today.

Today is the first class for the semester, and I'm glad to be back. There's lots of homeworks and quizzes to do though. Since I am graduating in 6 months, that means job searching too has to happen in parallel too. I have never job search as an international student, and seeing how you need 300+ application to get 1 offer, it's a little daunting.

So what I am doing? I know I want to target data engineering jobs, so I am focusing my time on prepping ala leetcode, `sql`, DE nuances and system design. These take a lot of time, and s I find myself asking if I should say no to certain events to just focus on this.

Despite all this, I think I just want to minimize regrets. I want to do all the prep I can do, so that when the time comes, I can say I did my best. No regrets.
