it's monday so it's the start of the 5 days work life again. i'm lucky i go to the office only 3 days a week and WFH the other days.

morning is pretty productive with me finishing a few of the tasks I want to look into. lunch is ok - it was bbq today. I realize I am bad in small
talks because I don't know what to say - maybe that's the disadvantage of being an introvert in an extroverted world. but it's fun listening to them. I learned about a new game called metroid prime that's coming out. it's a retro game and the graphics is quite nice considering it came out a while ago.

one of the meetings after lunch reminded me to always question what i'm doing so I can prioritise the right thing. that's something im still figuring out, to value the **value of time** i put in to each task i do

some things im thinking about

- i want to get a speaker so i can enjoy good music at home. was looking into sonos but price is a little high ðŸ˜­
