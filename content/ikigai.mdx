[Ikigai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai) is a japanese concept for thinking about the reason of living.

## Finding Ikigai

> 1. What do I love? (passion)
> 2. What am I good at? (vocation)
> 3. What can I be paid for? (profession)
> 4. What does the world need? (mission)

Achieving Ikigai is challenging, but the journey toward it is worthwhile. This feat won't be accomplished overnight; it may span multiple years and evolve over time.

For many, securing a vocation and profession comes relatively easilyâ€”it's nearly a given that what you do will align with what people need, and vice versa, due to the law of association.
However, what proves difficult is cultivating passion and a sense of mission from the factor of love.

While the law of economy may ensure that you satisfy three of the four Ikigai factors: what the world needs, being paid, and being skilled at something, finding true passion is a more complex challenge.
