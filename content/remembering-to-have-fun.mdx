During the [Bangkok trip](https://weichun.xyz/blog/bangkok-day-1), I had a lot of fun. One of the things that we talked about during the night was regrets during our younger days.

My answer that night was that I regretted **not having fun**.

I was in school with an asian mentality of studying hard and getting good grades. I didn't have fun. I didn't go out. I didn't do anything that was fun. I think it was also because I was more introverted at that time so I was fine with just being alone at home.

Now in my 20s, I want to try to experience more things. It's the period of time where you have the most energy. 

Some people may say that you should hunker down and work hard and enjoy later. For me, I think that's a bit too late. 

Work hard but also not too hard that you sacrifice social life and life itself. Go out there, try new things, meet new people.
