summary: 
---

- Woke up a 8am. Ealier than expected considering we slept at 4am yesterday night. A and YZ decided to sleep in. We went to Chatuchak market

- I thought Chatuchak was very small at first because most stores are closed, but as we walked further in, we realised that it was actually very big. It was divided into multiple section, each selling different things. 1 is for thrifted clothes, another is for handmade goods, another is for ointments and oils, etc

- Got our coffee fixed at Kaarom

- Queued for an hour for Hey Hai. Crab meat fried rice was super duper good. You should try out the garlic fried mantis prawn too

- Hanged out at Don Don Donki while waiting for YZ to finish his lunch with his friend. Played golf inside

- Sat in a Bolt for another 45 minutes to take pictures at 2 cafes. It was super worth it

- Arrived at After Rain cafe. It was a jungle themed cafe with a boat rowing experience. We took a lot of pictures here. Like > 400 of them

- Food was ok but boat rowing was fun. Me and A were in 1 boat while GW and YZ were in another. We raced each other to the end. The trick to "rowing fast" was instead of rowing, you us the paddle to push the banks of the river

- It was supposed to be 4 of us sharing 1 boat, but I guess A and I took too many pictures that the cafe just gave us another boat

- There's a swing at the cafe. We took more pictures there

- Short drive from there was the next cafe, Bubble in the Forest. It's a like a resort with huts over the blue pool. The food was kinda expensive here so we just took pictures

- BYD Dolphine is so quiet.

- Icon Siam is a super big mall. The ceiling is very high

- My iPhone was at 1% so I went to the Apple store to charge it

- Sat on the river cruise for 1 hour. It was seafood buffet so 4 of us definitely took advantage of it. Scenery was ok but the experience is good

- We wanted to get some foot massage but also were wary about sketchy places that offer more than just foot massage. We went to one that has good review nearby the mall. It was okay at best. I guess because it was close to late night, the masseuse were tired

- Ended the night by going to 7E and hauled a lot of snacks and drinks. We spend less 100 ringgit but got more than 10 bottles of drinks. I was very surprised on how cheap they were

- GW bought steamed bread with custard filling. It tasted weird

- They have no pink salt in 7E. We want to do a foot soak back in the AirBnB

- Somaek was the drink of the night. This is so good that you can't taste the alcohol. It's just sweet

- Talked about school life, work, love life and future plans

- YZ played youtube videos on chemistry reaction and we were all amazed by it. I think we were just tired by today
