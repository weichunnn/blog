Sometimes I find life pretty boring because I am almost stuck doing the same things day in and day out.

I go to school, I go to work, I do homework, I sleep, and repeat. It's a cycle that I feel like I can't escape. But then I realize that I can break out of this cycle by doing something creative.

Cooking is one of the things that I find creative and relaxing. I love trying new things, even when sometimes some of them don't turn out as expected<sup>1</sup>.

Instead of making this an ad hoc thing, I want to try to make creative output consistent. Be it learning a new language, crocheting, or anything else, I want to do it consistently enough. That way, I can have something to look forward to and also something to show for it.

Out of all the things I want to do, I think I want to try learning a new language next (Japanese?).

<sup>1</sup> Tried making Cantonese porridge one day with salted egg and century
egg. I wanted to mix it up a bit by adding minced pork, but I think I bought the
wrong one with fats (which made it very chewy). I also didn't take into account
the fact that salted egg is already very salty, so I added too much salt. Oh
well, lesson learned.
