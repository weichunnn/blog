cooked minced pork eggplant today but my oil was not hot enough, and the eggplant absorbed a lot of it so it was quite oily.
not wanting to take defeat, i countered by cooking canto bittergourd soup. I simplified it alot, but ingredients are: chicken/pork, large bittergourds, garlic bulb, carrots, tomatoes, dates/honey dates, salt & pepper to taste. no measurements here bacause malaysians cook agak-agak
there are also variations of it if you have more time - thai version where you use minced pork and stuff it into the bittergourd. this countered the oil and I like that my soup is sweeter from the carrots I put in

at night, i finally caved in and ordered the first thing I bought with my first paycheck: an [era 100 speaker](https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/era-100). very very excited for it to come so i can listen to good quality music
