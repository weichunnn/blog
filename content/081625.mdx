when i go for a meal with my friend, my first thoughts is always ayce buffets like hotpot or kbbq. the combination of being able to sit for 1.5 to 2 hours with food coming non-stop and companionship side by side is perfect.
you can talk now and eat later or you can eat now and talk later. the food is not going to be cold, you can order whenever you want. there's a range of prices for buffet so you can pick which fits the best. and there's also a lot of variety for you to pick.
it's maybe an asian thing but i love the communion way of eating and it feels much closer; you cook for others as well, and this is normally reciprocated back.

no food is better than unlimited food with friends, that's my hot take. im lucky that my friends group from high school and now graduate school is big so this style works.

ps. my favorite places in the city:

- AYCE hotpot: shabu club sf (limited selection), hotpot champ (more selection)
- hotpot: haidilao
- AYCE kbbq: YakiniQ
