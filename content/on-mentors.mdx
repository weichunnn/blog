During my road trip with two of my colleagues, we talked about mentors on a random afternoon while waiting for the sun to set.

We discussed how each person should have two types of mentors. One should coach you on life matters, while another guides you in your career. And in each of those categories, you should have a near-term mentor (who is 3-5 years ahead of you) and a long-term mentor (7-10 years ahead of you). YMMV.

A long-term mentor can show you the big picture and the path you can take, but they might not be able to give you the most up-to-date advice. That's where the near-term mentor comes in because they are closer to your current situation and can give you more relevant advice. It's like having a map and a compass.

I don't think I have established a proper mentor-mentee relationship with anyone yet. But I think I have a few people in mind that I can ask for advice when I need it.
