My kind of people are people who like this movie.

I don't know what else to say. It's different from your usual action-packed story where this is more slow and focuses more on his relationships with the people around him and the world - being in the moment and enjoying the little things in life.

> Hirayama

It taught me to **appreciate the little things in life** and to **be present in the moment**. There's no need to always be chasing after something. Sometimes, it's okay to just be.

> It’s a beautiful and moving depiction of how we can find clarity, acceptance, and joy by embracing the current moment and allowing our lives to unfold one day at a time. Hirayama would probably refer to this as **Komorebi**, a Japanese word that describes sunlight shining through the leaves of trees, creating overlapping layers of light and dark. As the film ends, we are shown the definition of Komorebi. We are told that this unique display of nature is ultimately fleeting, only existing very briefly in the current moment. The idea of Komorebi serves as powerful metaphor of the core theme of Perfect Days; it is a way for us to recognize and give ourselves over to the invisible, transcendent beauty of the moment that only exists in the here and now.
