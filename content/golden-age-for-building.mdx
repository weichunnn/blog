Build and Ship. 

That's the idea I am pushing myself and everyone to do more of. 

There's nothing stopping you from building the next great product because all the resource are freely available on the Internet. Maybe getting to know what tools are out there is slightly harder, but if you indulge yourself in updates from within the tech community, you'll at least catch wind of what's new and what's not.

The cost to get started in anything is lower today than yesterday. So whatever idea you have, don't just let it sit and be just an idea, implement and show it to the world.
