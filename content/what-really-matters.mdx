> It's not about living a long life, it's about living a good life

Having an end date to life really puts things into perspective and make us appreciate life as being previous. This documentary really made me think about what really matters in my life.

Watching it makes me sad and reminds me of a quote by Morrie Schwatz that goes like this:

> The truth is, once you learn how to die, you learn how to live.

I don't want to wait for that dreaded day and then start living my life. That would be such a waste of precious time. I want to start living my life now, and make the most of it.

I want to start ticking items off my bucket list, and start living a life that I can be proud of. I want to be able to look back at my life and say that I have lived a good life. I want to be appreciate the little things in life, and be grateful for the friends and family that I have. 

Before it's too late. And everyone should too.
