Naval Ravikant said that the three most important questions you have to guess correctly or face a lot of heartbreak are:

1. Who you marry? 
2. Where you live?
3. What you do?

I think that's true. People often time treat these questions nonchalantly and just go with the flow. But having these three questions thought out (at least early on) can change your life trajectory.

For me, there are (as of today)

1. I don't know yet. Probably someone who is kind, understanding, and have the same values as me.
2. San Francisco (for the tech and culture) then Europe (for peaceful retirement)
3. Software/Data Engineering while building something that could replace my full time job on the side
