I personally believe strongly in 'Win together, lose alone' as a leader. 

Attribute your wins to the wider team so people feel appreciated for their hard work and results. Actions and output are collaborative efforts and should be celebrated as such.

On the other hand, a good leader should take the lost and not blame the team for it. They are the ones shielding the team from the higher ups and should justify the team's actions and decisions.
