Stay calm when you are facing a problem. That's already winning half the battle. 

Today, I went into autopilot mode when I was solving a problem raised but what I should had done is **to ask more questions to understand the problem better**. Then only I can help myself to help them better.

I managed to get the problem solves eventually, but I think the path could be easier if I were to ask more questions and push back a little bit.
