If you think about it, is there anything interesting to talk about walking? Not much right. But to Rajiv Surendra, he made it interesting.

He described walking with so much details and explained what he see and feel while he walks. Tying back to the previous post on [The Art of Slow Living](https://weichuntan.com/blog/the-art-of-slow-living), I think this exemplifies the idea of being present and mindful in the moment. Look around and see your surroundings.

So take off the AirPods you have on, and just walk. You might be surprised at what you see and feel.
