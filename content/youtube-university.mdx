These days, I caught myself spending a lot of time on YouTube (not for the wrong reasons) - instead, watching hour-long content from technical talks to courses on social engineering. I realize that there's so much great content put out in video format, but people need to spend a lot of time looking and listening. Plus, the content are usually spread out across different timestamp in the video, making it hard to find the exact information you're looking for.

Then I thought of an idea. What if we could leverage LLM tools to ingest these videos and provide us with bite-sized summaries and insights, similar to what Blinklist is doing but for videos? Instead of relying on humans to listen -> transcribe -> summarize, we offload all of this tedious and time-consuming task to an AI and allow users to just focus on consuming.

Another aspect of this is also to allow users to curate content and publish playlists of articles/videos that other users can follow along. For example, essentials to public speaking. This allow content creators to monetize their content in a different way, and also allow users to learn from the best.

The goal for this is to democratize learning from video content and make it much more efficient. No more days of spending hours watching a video only to realize it's not what you're looking for.
