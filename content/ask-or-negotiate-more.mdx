Today I went to a dermatologist to ask about some skin issues I have. After the consultation, I was given a prescription for some medication. There are also some products that she recommended me to use as well. 

I hadn't heard of the product brand before so I assumed that it was something you could get from her clinic only. Until when I got back home, I did some research and found out that the products are actually available in the market and at a much lower price.

Hence why I think it's important to ask more questions and negotiate more.

One of the main reasons to do this is to protect yourself and make sure you are not being taken advantage of. You can always get a better deal even though you thought the current one they offered is already good.

In general, just ask for things, even if you’ve never heard someone ask for them

It’s okay if the things are crazy. You can always mollify afterward by saying “**I know that’s a crazy thing to ask for, but I have a rule that I always ask.**”
