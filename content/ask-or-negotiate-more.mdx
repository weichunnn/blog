One of the main reasons to do this is to protect yourself and make sure you are not being taken advantage of. This especially works pretty well for sales/money related things where price is always not really absolute and there’s always room for negotiation.

You can always get a better deal even though you thought the current one they offered is already good.

In general, just ask for things, even if you’ve never heard someone ask for them

It’s okay if the things are crazy. You can always mollify afterward by saying “I know that’s a crazy thing to ask for, but I have a rule that I always ask.”
