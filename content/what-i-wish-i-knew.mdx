I came across Sam Altman's post today talking about [what he wished he knew earlier.](https://blog.samaltman.com/what-i-wish-someone-had-told-me) I resonated to some of them which I think are important to me as well. Here are some of them:

1. It is easier for a team to do a hard thing that really matters than to do an easy thing that doesn’t really matter; audacious ideas motivate people.

2. Outcomes are what count; don’t let good process excuse bad results.

3. Superstars are even more valuable than they seem, but you have to evaluate people on their net impact on the performance of the organization.

4. Fast iteration can make up for a lot; it’s usually ok to be wrong if you iterate quickly. Plans should be measured in decades, execution should be measured in weeks.

5. Inspiration is perishable and life goes by fast. Inaction is a particularly insidious type of risk.

6. Get back up and keep going.
  
7. Working with great people is one of the best parts of life.
