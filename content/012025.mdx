I bought a gigantic eggplant - it was so big that it fit my entire metal bowl. It's the length of my entire upper body up to my shoulders.

I originally wanted to try cooking [Tortang Talong](https://iankewks.com/tortang-talong/) with it. This is a Filipino dish that combines eggplant with an omelette. It's usually served over steamed rice and ketchup. But since I don't have a grill, which is essential for that burnt smoky taste (also because my eggplant is too big), I put this off.

I decided to go back to my roots and make it Chinese style.

[Chinese Eggplant with Minced Pork](https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-eggplant-garlic-sauce/).

If you follow that recipe, it's great. I decided to simplify it.

1. Slice the eggplant at 45 degrees to create slices (not too thick).
2. Grab minced pork and season it well with salt and pepper.
3. Slice ginger into thin strips. Cut 1 onion bulb and dice a few garlic cloves.
4. Fry the aromatics in a wok until they're golden brown. Then put in the minced pork.
5. Leave it for a bit until the pork is 60 - 70% cooked.
6. Add some water and your eggplant in.
7. Add appropriate amounts of soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and sesame oil.
8. Cover the wok and wait until the eggplant is soft - stir it once in a while.
9. Feast - add green onion/red chili to make it more pleasing.

I also love eggplant cooked in [Yong Tau Foo](https://www.wokandkin.com/stuffed-tofu/) style. However, instead of minced pork, you need fish paste for this to make it authentic.
