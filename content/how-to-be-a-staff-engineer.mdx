A staff engineer is a significant milestone in an engineer's career. It is a role that coupled with a lot of [influence and thus likeability and credibility](https://weichun.xyz/blog/influence-likability-credibility).

Often time, communication is the key to success. When a Staff Engineer speaks, they have a common attribute:

So what can you improve to become a Staff Engineer?

1. **Organization awareness**. Look across your team, start building network and learn what others are doing.

2. **Problems.** Look internally on the team's stuggles. What is the biggest problem that can be solved that would yield the largest impact? Are you not only saying but also delivering?

3. **Productivity.** Are you able to spot problems **AND** offer a solution to it so another outstanding person can take care of it?
