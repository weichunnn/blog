Today, a colleague of mine asked me about some resources to help him strengthen this fundamentals as an engineer. We briefly talked about interview prep, leetcode, how to become a staff engineer, and so on. I thought it would be a good idea to write a blog post about this topic (since I will be prepping soon as well ðŸ¥²)

I did [Neetcode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice) the last time round for interview prep. But apart from that, I think this is a good list to go over to help you to learn and understand the most common form of data structures and algorithms. 

Practice a lot of this. Regardless of discipline, you will be asked to solve problems in interviews.

I found [lanki.xyz](https://www.lanki.xyz/) for spaced repetition of leetcode problems. I haven't try it out yet but this seems good.
