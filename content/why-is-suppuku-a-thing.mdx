*Seppuku* or *Harakiri* is the act of taking one's life that was considered honorable. I seen this a lot when I was watching the [Shogun](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2788316/) series. 

Typically there are reasons why a person commit seppuku.

1. If he had lost a battle, he wants to avoid mistreatment by his captors avoid accusations of being a coward.
2. If he had committed a crime, it's more dignified to take his own life in private than to be executed in public, which is shameful.
3. Carrying out the practice of Junshi where a person would follow their lord to death as a way to show supreme loyalty.

I appreciate that this is a cultural thing and it's considered the highest form of honor that a Samurai can do. But I still find it hard to understand why a person would take his own life over something that can be resolved in a different way. For example, to live in remorse or to make amends for the wrong that he had done. Taking one's life is a permanent solution to a temporary problem which only makes it hard for your family and friends.

p.s The practice was eventually banned by the [Tokugawa Shogunate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_shogunate) in 1663 because it's better to keep the Samurai alive to fight another day.
