After reading Alain de Boton book on "How Proust Can Change Your Life", I've been thinking more about characteristics and personalities lately. Some people I like to be friend with or people I have find attractive are those who:

- are [agentic](https://weichun.xyz/blog/being-agentic) in nature
- have good taste and hobbies
- are curious to learn something new
- always open to new experiences
- are kind and good-hearted
- are good listeners
- notice the small things or details in life
- tell you things straight to the point
- are not afraid to be wrong and admit it
- pushes you to be better
