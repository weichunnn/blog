Instead of thinking about the worst case scenario, think about what you can do to make things better, to increase you luck surface area. 

Think that you can make it instead of worrying you can't. The former makes you do something, while the later just plays in your head.

Do things that will increase your chances of succeeding.

Think positive and act on it.
