Rule of thumb: If someone brags about their success or happiness, assume it's half of what they say. If someone downplays their success or happiness, assume it's double what they say. 

The more we are secure about ourselves, the less we need to prove to others. The less we need to signal. The less we need to brag.

Remember: having envy from other people is not an asset but more of a liability. Don't need to strive to get other people attention when they will come naturally as you become better.
