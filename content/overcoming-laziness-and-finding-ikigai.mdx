I came across few words on the internet that Japanese people often stem their life on. These are some new words worth keeping in the back of your mind.

1. **Kaizen.** Make small improvements. Encourage small, achieveable goals and small gains. Aim to become 1% better every day rather than perfection.

2. [**Ikigai**](https://weichun.xyz/blog/ikigai). You reason for being alive. Have a purpose for your life. What's the reason that you wake up in the morning?

3. **Wabi Sabi.** Beauty in imperfection. Accept the natural state of things and imperfection and that's okay. Japanese has a very special activity for this called Kintsugi, where they repair broken pottery with gold. The idea is that the pottery is more beautiful after it's been broken and repaired.

4. **Shosan.** Have a beginner mindset. Be open to learning anything to fulfil your mind.

> "If your mind is empty...it is open to everything. In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert's mind there are few." - Shunryn Suzuki

5. **Ganbaru.** Doing your best. No matter the circumstances, do your best. It's not about the outcome, it's about the effort.

6. **Shirin-Yoku.** Forest bathing. Spending time in nature is good for your mind, soul and body.

7. **Hara Hachi Bu.** Eat until you're 80% full. Don't overeat. More than that, you are most likely to be lazy and sleepy.
