As we grow older, time seems to pass by faster. Every year seems shorter than the last. I remember when I was a kid, Chinese New Year is always so far away and when it comes, it feels like forever. Now, it feels like it's just around the corner till the next time. 

There's a reason for this. Human measure things relatively, and that includes time as well. When we are 1 year old, one year is all that we know. But as we grow older, one year slowly become a small fraction of our life. For example when we are 10 years old, one year is 10% of our life. But when we are 50 years old, one year is only 2% of our life. Check out this great [visualization](https://www.maximiliankiener.com/digitalprojects/time/) on this.

In other words, our perception of time and how much it has passed is logarithmic instead of linear.

With only 2.5 months more in Malaysia before I fly off to San Francisco, I thought a lot about the time I have left here and how I can make the most of it with **family** and friends.
