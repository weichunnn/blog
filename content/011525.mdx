I learned another simple dish that I had been making for a few meals now.

It's as simple as it gets. Called **Khai Jiao** - Thai style omelette. It's such a comfort food that you can have with anything.

Plain rice? ✅

Porridge? ✅

Noodles? ✅

Receipe:

1. Mix 2 eggs, 1 tsp of fish sauce, 1/2 teaspoon of lime/vineger, 1 tablespoon water and 1 tablespoon of flour (corn starch is the best)
2. Fry it in a pan with lots of oil
3. So easy!

Things to note:

- Khai Jiao needs more oil than usual, so just dump 2-3 times more oil. We want about 1 inch deep of oil in the pan.
- Pouring from different heights will give you different textures. About 1 foot (30cm) is ideal to get crispy edges.
- If you want it fancy: pour the mixture though a sieve to get a nice lacy texture.
