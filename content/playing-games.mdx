Recently, I started playing games again. I know, it's wasting time, not productive blah blah blah. That's why I don't really go into it deeply such that I forget to eat and poop. 

I thought about why games are addictive and why people play it. For me, it's the sense of achievement and improvement. I like to improve daily, being good at something and then being offered to be better. I don't think it's the UI that makes me play, it's the competition between myself and others that I thrive upon.

Most people misinterpret the reason why people play games. It's not because they are lazy or they don't have anything to do. It's especially for the reasoning I mentioned.

How I realize this? Regularly introspecting the cognitive principle behind the things I am doing helps me to know why I am doing it. Don't settle by looking at it only on the surface level, dig deeper. Because those principle can be applied elsewhere as well for example, in the 80 years game that we are all playing right now. 

How do you improve yourself daily?

p.s It's Clash of Clans.
