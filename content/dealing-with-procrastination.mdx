Procrastination is unavoidable. It's literary build into our DNA, as we crave immediate satisfaction, even when it's not the best for us long term. Human also [tend to think short term](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/10/21/1009443/short-term-vs-long-term-thinking/) which exacerbates this problem.

Although procrastination produces stress that actually correlates to a performance boost, relying on procrastination itself as a stress producer limits our growth and potentials.

## Types of Procrastination

- Type I - Procrastination on simple daily things like doing laundry, buying groceries, replying to emails etc
- Type II - Procrastination on longer term projects, leading to us failing to make progress

## Fighting back

Here are some types of fighting back recommended by Sahil Bloom:

1. **Awareness**: Schedule a time within the day to ask these questions. Answering them with a 'no' is a signal of procrastination.

   - Am I proud of the actions I am taking on these big projects?
   - Am I doing what I should be doing?

2. **Deconstruction**: Big abstract problems scares us. Break down these problem into smaller manageable chunks of tasks.

3. **Plan Creation**: Once you know what to do, plan a timeline for it. Be specific on what to do and time-box it to keep yourself accountable. We often overestimate what we can do in a day but underestimate what we can do in a year. Hence, be more generous on the timeline when setting short term goals.

4. **Stake Creation**: Create and raise stakes for the things you want to do. Put yourself up for it.
   Some examples are like:

   - Doing a **public declaration** of what you are building.
   - Setting up **social pressure** by telling a close friend what you want to do
   - Giving yourself a **reward** if you finish the task
   - Setting a **penalty** if you don't complete

5. **Action**: The first step is always the hardest. But after that, according to [Newton's 1st law of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion), it gets easier due to inertia. Creating small wins that continue to motivate your journey helps in this case.

- Look into [Eisenhower 2x2 Decision Matrix](https://slab.com/blog/eisenhower-matrix/#:~:text=The%20Eisenhower%20Matrix%20is%20a,you%20should%20delegate%20or%20delete.) to know what to do.
- Block out one hour at the start and end of the day to do tactical tasks that give you immediate satisfactions.
