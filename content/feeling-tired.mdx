Today is unusually tiring and un-motivational. I am not too sure why? 

The feelings sucks because I want to spend time doing something but I am just roaming around the house. Occasionally, taking a nap and waking up quickly after. I thought this helped but it didn't.

I have been on med for the past 2 weeks, taking daily doses of [Acutane](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/19186-isotretinoin-capsules) and Antibiotics. This stuff helped a ton with skin acne but I am definitely experiencing the side effects now. I also cannot each a huge bunch of things because of it. It's like a love-hate relationship with the med. 

I feel like a zombie ðŸ§Ÿ Aimless with energy draining off quicker than your iPhone.

I hope this feeling goes away soon. 

Some things I am looking forward to for the coming weeks:

- Going out for meals to catch up with friends and colleagues before;
- Leaving to SF
- Resting at home after quitting
- Trip to Bangkok
- Building [Onyx](https://backdropbuild.com/builds/v4/nous-s4lp) (holy, summarization is hard - probably this is a good PhD topic I would do.)
- Time to read and write more
