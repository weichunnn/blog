played a new game today called Azul. if i were to describe it, it's like a variation of bingo but super fun!

you start with a blank piece of board and in the middle, you draw random tiles from the bag and fill up the colored circle in the middle.
each turn, you draw from the middle (choosing 1 circle) and only pick 1 of the color, the rest are the put in the middle (this now become a bunch you can draw from).
you use the same colored tiles to fill up the left side of your board. at the end of each round, the filled up row goes to the right.
the goal is to collect most point ie from having a row/column or just filling up the same color on the board.

it lasted about 40 minutes and i like that the pieces are very pretty. it's old school vibe but pretty.
