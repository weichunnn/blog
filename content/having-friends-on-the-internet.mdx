Lately, I had been exploring making friends with random stranger on the ~~street~~ Internet. I had some success with it, but I have to say it's not easy.

Why I started? After graduating from school, most of my days are spent working in the office. I don't have much time to meet new people outside of work...maybe [Socratica](https://www.socratica.info/) could help (B and I are working on starting a [Malaysian node](https://lu.ma/socraticakl)). There are of course my colleagues, but I don't want to only talk about work.

How? I started scrolling on Twitter a lot and notices there's actually a lot of gold here. Whenever I see someone cool, I will drop a follow and a DM asking something that we could both relate like

- "Hey, I saw you're also into XX, I'm also into XX! How did you get started?"
- "What's the most challenging thing you are doing now?"
- "What are you thinking about?"
- "What have you been reading lately?"

I try to be active and tweet daily so that people can see what I'm up to. If I were to build credibility, I need to have some good metrics to show, and to do that I need to be active.

Results? I managed to interact with some cool people and learn about what they are doing. I also got some good advice from them.

This year, I'm trying to make to 1000 followers and along the way, make 100+ friends too.

I'm on Twitter at [@\_weichunnn](https://twitter.com/_weichunnn), let's be friends!
