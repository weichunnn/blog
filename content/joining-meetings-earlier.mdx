Try joining in a meeting 5 - 10 minutes early and talk to people about their day or weekends.

I think this is an underrated way to build relationships with people.
Most of the calls I attend, either people join in on time or late or they muted themselves (leaving no room for small talk).

p.s On the topic of meetings, I think they should be scheduled on by default 20 minutes rather than 1 hour.
