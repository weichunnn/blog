Ever since Covid happened or since I spend my time on the screen a lot more these days, I realized that my default is to set videos to 2x speed.
To the point that, if it's not, it's too slow.

It's certainly great for productivity but what I notice is that I have **lower attention span** and I sometimes **talk at a faster pace than usual**.
These are something that I have to watch out for.

I also watch movies at 2x speed unless it's a complex one or it's a movie that has good reviews.
I am fine with it because I only 2x the speed for mediocre movies or movies that I watched to get a quick break.

Here's what I think 2x movies speed miss out on:

- Ruins the pacing of the movie and causes scenes that needs to linger around to be less impactful
- Ruins the dialog and background music
- Tension is not built up properly
