With social media proliferating all over, is taste is still a thing in the modern world?

For someone who is scrolling through social media, their taste are always being evaluated, and they are always getting fed the same content they watch.

It's harder to find that confrontation or experience that helps your discover things that you like. These algorithmic recommendations prevents us from being challenged and surprised all the time, like everything is already expected. When is the last time, you actually find something totally new (out of the domain) that you like?

Another chain of thought - Humans had moved away from being attached to a curator's taste to averaging out what everyone thinks. For example, there used to be a curated list of movies that someone would recommend, but nowadays, people flock to Reddit to search for what's the best movie to watch in 2024 and then pick the most upvoted one or the most mentioned.

But think of it, why would you want a generic experience?

I think we can all agree that stepping away from social media would be a good step to take. It's hard in the beginning but it's worth it. It took me a while but I am glad I am now experiencing things to find out my likes and dislikes.
