I am a night owl, that means I am more productive at night. This is me writing this article at 2am in the morning.

With my active brain at night, some times I find it hard to sleep.

Here are some tips I found useful to help me get some shut eye.

1. Be tired in the first place, have plenty of mental and physical exercise throughout the day.

2. When you cannot sleep, lie on your back staring at the ceiling and think of nice thoughts. You can use this time to reflect on your day and think about gratitude.

3. Read for an hour before bed.

4. Remove all screens at least an hour before sleep.

5. Go to bed early, at the same time every day.

6. Aim for 8 hours, although it's hard to achieve these as you get older.

7. Be happy. Clearly stress and worry interrupt sleep.

8. Avoid sleeping pills. The drugs donâ€™t work, they just make it worse.

9. Absolutely no caffeine after 3pm. Whether it's coffee or tea. Caffeine stays in your system for from 8 to 10 hours, so this will disrupt your sleep schedule.

10. If you can't sleep, do something else rather than worry and lying in bed. I usually just get up and read another chapter, and that usually does the trick.
