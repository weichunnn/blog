recently, I had been exclusively using waymo as my mean of transport with a big caveat. as long as i'm able to apply my $10 discounts that comes from referrals. with that, it became free or <$3. just browse the [waymo referral reddit] (https://www.reddit.com/r/waymo/comments/1kl9702/waymo_mega_invite_referral_codes/?sort=new), you can use it as many times as you want.

waymo is much cheaper in the city at odd hours ie midnight, 8-9am, 11am, 2pm - 4pm, 9pm to early mornings. my theory is that there are not many people on the other ride sharing platform and this drives down demand

fun fact: if you catch yourself running late and the waymo is about to leave, just open the trunk from the app. with my experience, they stay for quite some time until it's too long and customer support dials in
