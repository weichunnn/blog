> Why is he so consistent in doing his work and why is he so good at it? Why can't I stop procrastinating and be like him?

A lot of people ponder about that on others.

But truth be told, he or she faces his or her own difficulties and challenges as well.
Procrastination, laziness, and all the negative emotions that you can think of are always lingering around.
The temptation to relax or quit is always there.

Despite that, he **still shows up and does it anyway**, even though the work may be bad or the worst of all time.
Why? Because showing up and just doing it matters.
It cultivates this sense of discipline and consistency that will help you to get better at it.
No matter the outcome, don't end the day with nothing.

Personally, I am writing daily now and I am not sure I am good at it. But, one thing I am sure of is that I'm improving daily and I am not ending the day without writing one.
