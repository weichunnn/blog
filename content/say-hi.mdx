Hello, world!

No, not this. I am talking about reaching out to random strangers and just talking. It's a great way to get to know someone, learn something new, or just to have a good conversation.

> Everyone you meet knows something you don't.

Deep down, I've always wanted to be the person who is curious about what others are thinking or doing, learn about their experiences and stories, and then share them with others who might be interested in the future. New ideas and perspectives are always welcomed. I also sometimes get humbled down so I always open to being pointed wrong.

One of my biggest inspiration comes from Anne Kadet on her newsletter - [CAFE ANNE](https://annekadet.substack.com/). It features a broad series of interviews with people from all walks of life ([chess hustlers](https://annekadet.substack.com/p/life-advice-from-nyc-chess-hustlers), [senior citizen](https://annekadet.substack.com/p/scr4)). I love the way she asks broad questions and how she kept it simple and real.

How can you start? I started off with cold DMs on Twitter and then focused on reaching out to people at work because I spend most of my time here. Just pick someone on your Slack channel and send them a calendar invite for a 1-hour chat. It's that simple.

Don't know what to ask? Start with this [list of questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K_iFxFt9lh1i0mxKRIhOSd2e8X1LNvxnihbChKXhyOc/edit).

Maybe next time I would try it out in the park. I'll let you know then!

p.s I am always open to chat. Just reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/_weichunnn) or email -> weichuntan1211 at gmail dot com
