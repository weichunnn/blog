[Aftersun](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt19770238/) is another slow-moving movie that I watched recently. I realized why this deserves an Oscar right after.

This movie made it abundantly clear that depression and misery can be so internal that even those closest can miss the sign. Calum is careful to keep his feelings hidden from Sophie, and Sophie is too young to take notice of it, heck even as a viewer it took me a while to realize what was going on.

Friends and family are very important in my life, and I wouldn't want them to go through something without speaking about it. 

Sometimes it's hard to tell someone that you're not okay, but it's important to do so. Let it out and let someone help you.

I hope that I can be there for my friends and family when they need me.

p.s Is there a specific term for this types of movie? I wonder if 'slow-moving' is the right one.
