Today I went to a co-working space at Sri Petaling to have some focus time since I am WFH. The place was quite nice - it was quiet and there's free flow of snacks and drinks. 

I got myself some coffee to keep my system going and to start working.

I got a [Dirty Latte](https://www.dolce-gusto.co.th/en/inspiration/flat-white-and-dirty-latte) with double shot at first, then followed by a [Piccolo](https://distefano.com.au/blogs/coffee-blog/what-is-a-piccolo-coffee) few hours later.

That's a total of 4 shots. 

As I am going through my second cup, I felt so hyper and jittery that I couldn't focus on my work. I was just typing random stuff and my heart was beating so fast. My legs were constantly shaking and I just felt like walking and running around. 

Well, coffee is supposed to make you more alert and focused, but I think I was too energytic instead.

I guess a double shot is my limit and this is a reminder for my future self.

p.s Abid, my colleague is an avid coffee drinker and I am not sure how he can handle so many shots in a day. I should ask him about it.
