It's time for the bi-weekly grocery haul.

I used to not like going grocery shopping because it meant that I had to guard the shopping trolley and help my mom pick out good onions/meat. But I think, as I grew older, I started to enjoy the process ie finding good deals that I can use for my meal prep, figuring out which fruit is ripe, which meat is the freshest etc. I also started to like cooking more and more, so I guess that's a big part of it too (maybe another blog post on that)

Apart from the occasional trying out the new things, I usually stick to the same list because they are easy and quick to make

What I usually get:

### Costco

| ------------------------------ | ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| Chicken Thighs<sup>1</sup>     | $21.44     | Bone-in, ~$2.14/lb           |
| â”” Pork Loin Chops              | $19.99/6lb | ~$3.33/lb                    |
| â”” Pork Belly                   | $25.41     | ~$4.49/lb, so good for K BBQ |
| â”” Ground Beef<sup>2</sup>      | $24.99/5lb | 90% lean, ~3.49/lb           |
| Rotisserie Chicken             | $4.99      |                              |
| Atlantic Salmon (3lb)          | $31.79     |                              |
| White Fish (3lb)               | $21.99     | Cod/Mahi-mahi/Tilapia        |
| Eggs                           | $17.99     | Price for 5 dozens           |
| Kewpie Mayonnaise              | $5.99      | Best Mayo!                   |
| Portobello Mushrooms           | $5.99      |                              |
| Kirkland Peanut Butter         | $7.99/2pk  | 28oz each                    |
| Kiwi Box                       | $9.99      |                              |
| Pineapple                      | $3.99      |                              |
| Okois Yoghurt 18pk<sup>3</sup> | $12.99     | It's usually $1.5/ea outside |

<sup>1</sup> bone-in chicken thighs is tastier than dry chicken breast and you
don't lose out on much protein. skin-on is more economical than the
skinless/bonesless version + tastier

<sup>2</sup> this is kind of a [secret menu
item](https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/etsfom/yesterday_i_found_out_costco_actually_gets_93/)
so they don't display them. ask the butcher behind the window for it

<sup>3</sup> I don't really like the taste of the berry blend so that's a downer
(vanilla and strawberry are good though). Favorite one is definitely lemon but
it's not sold in Costco ðŸ¥²

<sup>4</sup> Turns out protein powder that I use is not as cheap as in Costco. I
use a mix of [rice protein](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09XHSJ7PP) and [pea
protein](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081SC57JM). Then mix it with some peanut
powder - I like [PBFit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08H56G22H)

Apparently, Costco didn't sell soy milk and hash brown so Trader Joe's it is

### Trader Joe's

| Item                     | Price        |                             |
| ------------------------ | ------------ | --------------------------- |
| Unsweetened Oat/Soy Milk | $3.99/carton |                             |
| Hash Browns              | $2.99        |                             |
| Super Lemon Room Spritz  | $3.99        | Makes my room smell so nice |

For carbs and side dishes, the asian store usually has better deals. Woori is my go-to store
since I like to walk around Japantown (Daiso is nearby too!)

### Woori

| Item            | Price       |                             |
| --------------- | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| White Rice      | $10.99/15lb | Look for Haitai Daipoong    |
| Homemade Kimchi | $12         | Pretty good and homemade    |
| Fish cakes      | $5          | Wang Korea Busan fish cakes |

### Chinatown Shops

My greens are usually from the grocery store in chinatown since I stay right in chinatown. I like that they are fresh and cheaper than stores like Whole Foods. The trick is to go later in the evening, because stores slash the prices throughout the day and you can get some good deals. I usually go to [HuaXing](https://maps.app.goo.gl/F6vNcDKn4r3BNV4w9) for veges and [Fruit City](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DvpRcWr356hnyKVn9) for bananas
