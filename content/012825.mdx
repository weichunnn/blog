It's CNY eve and it's my first time spending it away from family.

I feel a little sad because this is the time I most look forward to every year. I love the atmosphere, where cousins come together and gossip, the food, the shouting and laughter when we play a game of blackjack, the red packets, the fireworks, and the list goes on. Oh also, being able to talk to my uncles and aunts about their lives and their experiences. And of course, angpowes! ðŸ˜†

Not forgetting the reunion dinner where it's a custom that our family orders a [Lok Lok truck](https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/pjh5if/lok_lok_is_the_og_food_truck_of_malaysia_whats/) and we eat till we drop. We are quite a big family so it's usually finished in no time. It's a truck filled with different type of skewers and we either dip them in boiling soup hotpot style or deep fry them. It's so good!

This year, I spent it with my closest friends, A and B. We had a simple dinner at Yee's restaurant where we had our first dinner when we came to the city. The ngau-nam is still as good as ever. So one thing that happened here was that I accidentally tipped the waiter 6 cents instead of 6 dollars. The machine didn't read the decimal point. I was so embarrassed when I realized it. The waiter then came over and asked me if I made a mistake and I was like "Oh no, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to do that." I quickly took out some cash from my bag and put it on the table. Sorry Mr. Yee!

Good food, better company.

Throughout our time eating, the sky was just filled with explosions left, right, and center. It was worse than Malaysia because these fireworks are very low and loud. I felt like I was in the middle of World War 3.

Then after that, we went to an event meetup but Adrian's registration wasn't approved so we couldn't all go up. I gave him an egg tart and we went back to his apartment to watch a movie and to countdown to the new year.

We watched '[God of Gamblers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P67bpsowH9s)' and it was so funny. I like the part where they set up a trap to catch the Indian guy with dogs just because he was blocking their way. This movie is such a CNY classic.

10..9..8..7..6..5..4..3..2..1.. Happy New Year!

Where's the explosion? Oh wait, it's just a few fireworks. We came to a conclusion that the majority of the fireworks were at 9-10pm and Chinatown is filled with old people who had already gone to bed.

Went back around 1.30am and I was so tired. It's a work day tomorrow, I need to sleep now.

Good night and Happy New Year! ðŸ§§ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽŠ
