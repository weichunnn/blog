Naval's famous tweetstorm about [getting rich](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103360646823936) remains relevant up till today. Here's my top 10 picks from his thread:

1. Seek wealth, not money or status.

2. Renting out your time is a recipe for poverty. Own a piece of business instead that can make money while you sleep.

3. Focus on ideas that society wants, but does not yet know how to get.

4. Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.

5. Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.

6. Build specific knowledge that are highly technical or creative - not easily taught by others, outsources or automated. This skill is found through genuine curiosity and passion.

7. Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgement.

8. Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers.

9. Reading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching.

10. Work as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you work.
