Lately I've been trying to be aware of unlearning things so that I can be selective of what I put into my tiny brain. 

Everyday, I thought to myself that the world is so much bigger than I thought it was. Just so many interesting things to read, learn and do, but only limited time and space.

By emptying your cup and being open to new ideas, you can learn more. If you are so full of yourself, then everything that you learn will be filtered through your own biases and preconceptions.
