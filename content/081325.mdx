WFH today and got myself a bad headache. for lunch, i cooked a combination of chicken wings, rice wine, ginger, dates, and ginseng roots my mom got me. the last 4 all being yeet hay food which i realized only after finishing. that concoction led me to get this pain in the head and feeling very dry in the throat.
lesson learned

on a separate note, the sonos speaker arrived! i spent the evening setting it up and playing with EQs. i love the bass and loudness that i get from it (i can blast music at 3am and no one complains since i live on the ground floor).
it's so much better than my MBA speakers. one part of the setup process was very cool when they play a unique chime of the speaker and your phone connects with it automatically. the only difficult part is figuring out where to place it to maximize enjoyment - i ended up placing it right in front of desk near the curtains

note: in asian dishes, there's a term called _yeet hay_ which directly translate hot air. you categorize food that cause you to be heaty with it ie fried chicken (skin), spicy soups, fried rice, dried chips etc
