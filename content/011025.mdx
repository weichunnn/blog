I feel guilty sometimes that I don't call my family often enough. During the first month of moving abroad, I called them almost daily, then after that life got busy and I started to call them less and less. I know they understand, but I still feel guilty.

These days, I have a specific time slot every 2 - 3 days to call them. At least now I have a routine to look forward to and I can update them on what happened in my life.

**姐姐** plays a very big role in my life. She is someone that I always had fun being around, and she is the one that can make me laugh the most. We consumed the same jokes, so we always laugh at the same things. Despite all the laughter, she has also been the one who has supported me the most in every problem I faced. **姐姐** is the one that I share all the good news and bad news first. It could also be because we had a lot of shared experiences growing up ie getting scolded for not doing the dishes, forgetting to hang the laundry, forgetting to take the clothes in when it's pouring, forgetting to cook the rice etc, that we got closer because of these 'traumas'.

For **哥哥** (or in cantonese - gor gor), I look up to him a lot. He had always been the most successful one in the family and I always wanted to be like him. However, because of his work, I seldom get to see him. I appreciate the times that he comes back home to visit us, because he would tell us a lot of stories and the Legos he bought (It was him that introduced me to legos). Gor also maintains a strong sense of responsibility in the family and I can tell he always put family first. I hope I can talk to him more often.

❤️
