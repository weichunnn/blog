Today is the first day of Chinese New Year.

I stayed up pretty late last night, as we performed prayers to the God and wished for a prosperous year ahead. The joss stick that we burnt is large, so I stayed up till the late night, around 2am, to ensure that it had burnt out completely.

I woke up at 11am today. I quickly took a shower and got ready to go to my grandmother's house as it was a yearly tradition for all of her kids (my dad) to gather at her house for a reunion lunch. We reached at 12pm and were the first to arrive.

I greeted my grandmother and my aunts and uncles as they arrived. I also got to meet my cousins and caught up with them too. Ang Paos were exchanged, and conversations started. It was loud and lively.

I didn't eat lunch there since my family are vegetarian for the day, and my mother had prepared lunch at home. We left at about 3pm.

We ate, watched a series of [Exchange Love](https://mydramalist.com/745105-exchange-season-3), and then I took a short nap.

At 7pm, we ate dinner. We wanted to go to the temple to visit and see the night scene, but most of them close early. There are some that are still open till 11pm, but they were all too far. We decided to go to the temple tomorrow instead.

Instead, we went to my grandmother's house for a 'game' night üÉè. My cousins were there. It was fun, and we laughed a lot.

We left at 11.30pm. I was feeling a little hungry, so I went to a nearby 'mamak' to grab some food. I ordered 2 pieces of [tosei](https://ms.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tosai) and a glass of [teh halia](https://www.foodliteracycenter.org/recipe/ginger-milk-tea-teh-halia) (they gave me pure ginger water instead, and it was spicy). The day ended at 1am.
