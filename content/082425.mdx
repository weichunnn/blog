went out and eat harajuku sushi today with J from the startup that I worked with in the past. the environment is cozy, warm and quiet. they were only a few people in restaurant
so it's a nice play to eat. the owner was very nice and we ate a bunch of different sushi (might be 1 of each if i remember correctly). in ayce, i don't normally get full very quickly but
it's different when it comes to raw food like sashimis. i tapped out after the 3rd round and J did as well

on the way back, J and I talked about exhaustion when working on a startup. sometimes he feels guilty about not working on the startup or iterating on it to make it better. but also it makes
him tired very easily - so is it a passion problem, an age problem or .... I see this as everyone have their own pace and told him he don't need to rush it, going for the marathon is better than
a short sprint.

p.s J is someone I admired and learned from a lot from
