I watched a course on Shaan talking about how he utilized his relationships with people to get to where he is at. Here are some of my notes while watching:

1. Many people want to help you, but you have to keep an open mind or skill to be able to leverage them

2. Many people struggle to ask for help
    * The things is you always need help - you will always stagnate in life
    * You don’t see the overall big picture

3. You need people in life that is ahead of you
    * Short term 
    * Long term

4. How to ask for help?
    * Go direct - start with a precise and small question (well scoped out)
    * Focus on people 2-3 steps ahead of you 
   
5. Build your surface area -> give people opportunity to reply or help you -> do your outreach
   * Write a one page document with your struggles or things you need help with
   * Video updates
   * Monthly newsletters
  
6. Anxiety around fear of judgment always hold people back
   * Think about the Spotlight effect - people are not thinking about you as much as you think they are

7. After people helped you, tell them the results after a day or two
   * People will lose incentives to help you otherwise
   * People will never be mad - just tell them if it failed and how you can do better

8. Help = long term relationships to be built
   * They are not one off requests 

9.  Know what you want

10. On advices
    * Never follow anybody’s advice blindly
    * Think about it as another person’s take
    * Be very wary

1.  Be relentless and shameless but respectful
