Yesterday, I was catching up with some of my friends from college. One of the topic that came up was astrology. ZY told me that astrology is more detailed in horoscope and it helped her to understand herself better. I was curious and decided to check it out.

Most of the reports I found online were filled with ads or required me to pay to get the entire thing. 

But I ended up with one that was free and gave me the 3 main things ZY asked me to look at: sun, moon, and rising sun.

I'm a scorpio sun, libra moon, and taurus rising sun - [explanation here](https://www.vogue.in/content/star-sign-dates-traits-and-symbols-explained-for-each-zodiac-sign).

It's fun to read and see how it relates to you yourself. Not too sure if I am convinced by it yet but it's definitely interesting.
