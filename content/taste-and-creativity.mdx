> Good taste' is simply to have a well formed opinion, in accordance with the realities of the Good and the True - John Folley

**Taste** is a word difficult to be defined and when people ask us, we usually answer it as 'in the eye of the beholder', 'unique' or 'creative'.

**Taste** is built up over time and it's an individual sense or gut feeling that dictates your everyday decision making. The minute and minor decision making of likes and dislikes that happen in your brain each time you make a choice on a subject that has no correct answer is **Taste**.

On being rich. I personally believe you don't need to be rich to have good **Taste**. I know people who had excellent **Taste** in the tools they use or the food the choose to eat yet will not spend more than 20 bucks on lunch.

**Taste** can be cultivated over time and is a valuable asset for creativeness and fulfillment. Here are some of my recommendations that you can easily do:

- Cafe hopping
- Museum visits
- Reading old classic novels
- Watching movies from [Rober Ebert List of Great Movies](https://www.rogerebert.com/great-movies)
- Listening to music from [Rolling Stone 500](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-albums-of-all-time-1062063/)
