According [Bronnie Ware](https://bronnieware.com/regrets-of-the-dying/), the top 5 regrets of dying are:

- I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me
- I wish I hadn't worked so hard
- I wish I'd the courage to express my feelings
- I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends
- I wish I had let myself by happier

In hindsight, I have many regrets stemming from the choices I made in the past. But as they say, hindsight is always 20/20. Many of these choices now seem regrettable, largely because I lacked experience and knowledge. I was young and naive back then, and in many ways, I still am.

What has helped is treating these regrets as learning experiences, helping me in moving forward in life. Looking ahead, I don't want to regret not doing things that make me happy, or things that makes us human, like reconnecting with old friends. Even if the outcomes aren't positive, I know that I've tried my best and I can live on without regrets.
