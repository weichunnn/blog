Although Obama said it's not always the case that you need to do the shiny things, I actually think that people should
prioritize things that have high impact and visibility. These are the ones that will generate the best use of your time.

Focus on **20% effort 80% impact**.

Some other thought related on the topic:

- Getting things done is better than getting things perfect.
- People should take ownership of the problem they specified and try to solve it instead of just talking about it.
