watched a clip from rowen huang today. she's a taiwanese that talks about the spiritual and psychic world

she talked about food having emotions. if you don't appreciate your food and gobble them out and even throw them away, the food will feel sad and emit a sad frequency - that vibration will then be absorbed into your body.
on the other hand, if you appreciate the things on your plate, food will be happy and regain it's colorful vibrant energy and you will be happy as well

takeaway: appreciate food ie the brocolli, meat or rice on your plate
