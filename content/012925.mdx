Unfortunately, it's a work day today so I couldn't sleep in. I woke up at 7am and got ready for work.

The sky is unusually cloudy today. It must be because of all the fireworks last night.

Work was pretty chill today, we are mainly polishing up the app for the upcoming release, and to help C with his event later in the evening.

We had lunch at [Dragon Beaux](https://www.yelp.com/biz/dragon-beaux-san-francisco), a dim sum restaurant in the city. The dim sum is so delicious albeit it's on the pricier side. The siu mai are XL sized with prawn, scallops, mushrooms in them. It's not usual siu mai from the roadside. The pork ribs are also very tender. Overall, it's a very good experience!

At 6pm, we released the second version of the webapp, with more UX improvements and bug fixes. The last time we did this was Dec 31st's NYE. So maybe New Years are good days for releases?

Later in the night, I called my family because they were doing some visitation to my relatives' houses. I saw some of my cousins and wished them the usual '恭喜发财'，'身体健康'，'青春美丽'，'步步高升' and others.

p.s. It was after the meal that I realized we are not supposed to order porridge today. See [here](https://www.chinahighlights.com/travelguide/festivals/chinese-new-year-taboos.htm) to know why.
