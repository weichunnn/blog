Most of us have this question in our minds: "Who am I? What is my purpose in life? What do I do?"

Think of when you meet new people, and the first question is typically about self-introductions. Most would go with a resume-style introduction about work and what they do, maybe dropping a hint of hobbies into it. But is that really who you are? A job title...

I think it's important to know why we are different or special and why people should listen to us. It's about defining who we are, what we stand for, or care about. We don't need to mold ourselves to fit into a certain category or to be like someone else, because all of us view the world through our own unique lens, giving us this special perspective on life. Life's imperfect and so are we. Appreciate wabi sabi.

It may be hard to find our voice/story to do so, but I believe our current experiences is good enough. We just have to be authentic and realize the power of our voice and our opinions. They matter. They are important to someone.
