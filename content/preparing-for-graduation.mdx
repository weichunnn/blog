I am graduating soon (in a few days)! There's a lot to prepare for graduation, so I thought I'd write a list of things to do.

**Clothing**

- Graduation gown & cap (or rent from the school)
- Formal shirt
- Slacks
- Formal shoes (tip: don't wear sneakers up as that will ruin the whole look)
- Tie
- Belt
- Watch (optional)
- Coat (optional)

**Others**

- Purchase tickets
- Find places to take photos
- Hire photographer (optional)
- Invite family, friends & colleagues
- Plan transportation to and fro venue
