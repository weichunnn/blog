- Planned a retreat with a group of friends to reconnect.
- I [graduated](https://youtu.be/YRxL1sHSkJs) as the best student in Monash.
- Started my first full-time job as a data engineer, at [MoneyLion](https://www.moneylion.com/).
- Shipped a startup MVP called [Narrative.ai](https://narrative-ai.vercel.app/) in [Backdrop](https://backdropbuild.com/v2).
- Contributed to open source by fixing a bug in Airbyte.
- Wrote 64 blog posts this year.
- Finished watching [The Expanse](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3230854/) & [Three-Body](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt20242042/). Honestly, best sci-fi series ever.
- Applied to a bunch of universities for PhD and Masters.
- I didn't read much books this year but I did read a lot of [articles and papers](https://curius.app/wei-chun-tan). Curius is an awesome tool, seriously.
- Started tweeting on [twitter](https://twitter.com/_weichunnn) and realized what I missed out on.

## 2024

Resolutions are always something I set but forget along the way. This year, I want to try being more intentional about them, keeping track of them once in a while and see how am I progressing.

- Read more books. At least 12 of them.
- Be more open to new experiences with people.
- Host a reading group or a meetup.
- Learn the art of cooking.
- Find a personal sense of style. I like how [James](https://www.jquiambao.com/finding-my-signature-style) found his and it inspired me.
- Continue shipping, building and hacking things.
- Continue learning in public.

Now, 365 days to go to own it.
