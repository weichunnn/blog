- Planned a retreat with a group of friends to reconnect.
- I [graduated](https://youtu.be/YRxL1sHSkJs) as the best student in Monash.
- Started my first full-time job as a data engineer, at [MoneyLion](https://www.moneylion.com/).
- Shipped a startup MVP called [Narrative.ai](https://narrative-ai.vercel.app/) in [Backdrop](https://backdropbuild.com/v2).
- Contributed to open source by fixing a bug in Airbyte.
- Wrote 64 blog posts this year.
- Finished watching [The Expanse](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3230854/) & [Three-Body](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt20242042/). Honestly, best sci-fi series ever.
- Applied to 10+ universities for PhD and Masters.
- I didn't read much books this year but I did read a lot of [articles and papers](https://curius.app/wei-chun-tan). Curius is an awesome tool, seriously.
- Started tweeting on [twitter](https://twitter.com/_weichunnn) and realized what I missed out on.

## 2024

Resolutions are always something I set but forget along the way. This year, I want to try being more intentional about them, keeping track of them once in a while and see how am I progressing.

### Personal growth

- Read more books. At least 12 of them.
- Meet and talk to someone new every week. Make at least 52 new friends and keep in touch with them.
- Explore social media and increase my presence (get 1k followers on twitter). I've been a lurker for too long.
- Spend less than 30 minutes daily on random social media scrolling.
- Practice [wabi sabi](https://weichun.xyz/overcoming-laziness-and-finding-ikigai) instead of perfectionism in life.
- Keep track of time spent daily and [categorize them](https://www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/the-4-types-of-professional-time).

### Travel and Fun

- Solo trip to the Philippines.
- Visit Da Nang, Vietnam.
- Learn cooking and be good enough that people actually like eating.
- Find a personal sense of style. I like how [James](https://www.jquiambao.com/finding-my-signature-style) found his and it inspired me. (no more just hoodie, t-shirt and jeans)

### Health

- Build a healthy weekly exercise routine.
- Build a good sleep routine. Wake up earlier and sleep earlier.
- Take more cold showers than hot shower.

### Side Hustle

- Build and ship Narrative.ai or something cool and be successful at it.
- Start a newsletter and grow it to 100 subscribers. [Rabbit hole](https://weichun.xyz/blog/the-rabbit-hole) is a great inspiration for this.
- Continue learning in public and write daily blogs.
