Today, I came across this this quote by Dr. Seuss which is so true.

We often take things for granted until they're gone.

Since I bought my first iPhone, with a now decent camera in it, I've been taking a lot of photos. Everywhere I go I start to be more aware of my surrounding, looking into small things that I can capture and keep as a memory.

I didn't really do that before because my old phone had a terrible camera. But now, I'm so glad I did.

I also started to look into camera taking technique as well as editing them in Lightroom. It's so much fun. With just a little bit of preset, pictures can look 10 times better.

I want to start taking videos as well, so I can compile them and look back into the best time of my life now in my 20s. 

So, takeaway, **take more photos and videos**. You'll never know when you'll need them.
