Abstract from [How Warren Buffett Mastered Life](https://fs.blog/the-inner-scorecard/).

Recently, I felt that I do things just because someone else that I see on the Internet is doing it. That I did it because I crave the admiration of others. I did it because I wanted to be seen as successful, as someone who has it all together. 

This is a reminder to myself that I should not compromise my own standards, those I have set for myself. And to live life on my own terms, not someone else's.
