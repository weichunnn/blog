Who would have thought that I am now writing in public for a while now? I started by writing privately, not sharing it to anyone, preferring to keep my thoughts to myself.

But as I write more, I realize that I want to share my thoughts with others. So if anyone finds this and have some opinions, we can strike up a conversation. It's uncomfortable at first, but slowly it became something normal to me.

I think this can be applied to many things in life. I see life as being too uneventful if you stayed in your comfort zone forever - doing things that you know how to do and interacting with people you are familiar with. Why live life being mediocre when you can be so much more?

I try my best to push myself to get into uncomfortable situations, which although may make me look like the dumbest person in the room, it's fine as long as I take away something or be better than I was previously. 

You don't get used to it instantly, but slowly you'll realize that it's not that bad after all. **You slowly become comfortable with uncomfortable situation.**
