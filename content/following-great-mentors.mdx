> Great people are hard to find, and great mentors are even harder to find.

A new mindset I've recently adopted is to **focus less on the company and more on the people**.

In my early 20s, I've started to realize that the fame and prestige of a company can only take you so far.
It's the people you work with and learn from who help you grow and develop from withinâ€”**a growth that stays with you for a lifetime**.

In particular, the J-curve growth ðŸ“ˆ comes from great mentors who are willing to hold your hand and guide you to where they are, all the way while helping you avoid the pitfalls they faced.

In my opinion, I identify these people as those who are outstanding people managers; seniors who excel in influence and technical skills;
someone who grows and appreciates me; someone who always challenges each of my ideas in a positive way, and most importantly,
someone whom I respect and look up to as a role model.

So once you identify these people, stick around and learn as much as you can from them. Follow them because they are only so many of them.
