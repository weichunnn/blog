Guys are typically the logical ones in a relationship while girls are the emotional ones. Hence it follows that both have different perspectives on love.

Today, I learned about interesting perspectives on love when talking to some of my friends. Here are some of them:

- A guy thinks that he needs to conquer the world in order to save the girl, but on the flip side a girl think in order to conquer the world, she only need the guy.

- From a guy's perspective, the girl that he likes has 100 marks and this decreases as he gets to know her more. From a girl's perspective, the guy that she likes has 0 marks and this increases as she gets to know him more.

I feel that these applies to most people, but it's not always the case. It's interesting to see how different people perceive love.
