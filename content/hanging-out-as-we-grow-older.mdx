As we grow older, hanging out seems to be left to the past.
No more ad-hoc meetups or casually chilling in someone's home, playing games or watching cartoons.

Is this just the sad reality of adulting where all meetups are now planned and scheduled **catch-up sessions** planned **months ahead** - and we exchange what happened in our lives since the last time we met?
When this eventually happen, people are also very conscious on making this time productive so that these sessions do not waste their own and others' time.

I miss the days where we just hang out and do nothing.
Though it may break productivity, is it really something we should give up on?
