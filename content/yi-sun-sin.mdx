Today, I spent a good amount of time on a small part of korean history by watching the trilogy of movies on Admiral Yi Sun Sin.

- [Hansan: Rising Dragon](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21109538/)
- [The Admiral: Roaring Currents](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3541262/)
- [Noryang: Deadly Sea](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22813112/)

[Yi Sun-sin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_Sun-sin) was a Korean admiral and military general famed for his strategies and victories against the Japanese. His turtle ships and knowledge on currents and tides were instrumental in his victories.

He had major dedication to his country and his people even when they betrayed him due to a political conspiracy from a japanese spy. At that time, he was replaced by General [Won Gyun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Won_Gyun) who despite having superior odds, lost the battle.

**Moral of the story**

> Even with superior odds, you have to be good enough to leverage them.
> A bad general with good odds will still lose.

You have to be good enough to spot opportunities and use them to your advantage. And to arrive at that point is simply 1 thing: [increase your surface area of luck](https://weichun.xyz/blog/luck).
