That's it. That's how I write. 

I think for the most part, people don't blog/journal because they think it's hard to pen down their thoughts. But it's not. It's just a matter of starting.

Every day, you consume a lot of information, from articles, conversations, videos, your surrounding etc. You are bound to have thoughts and opinions about them because you are a human being.

So why not write them down? It's a good way to reflect on your thoughts and opinions.

Then the next question is, what do I write about?

I struggle with that question also. So far I cannot categorize my blog into a specific niche. I write about whatever I feel like writing about. 

I think that's the beauty of it. There's no restriction on what you can write about.

So just start writing. It doesn't have to be perfect. It just has to be you.
