I learned a new word today - it's called Agentic. Being Agentic meant that you are in control of yourself to organize your own goals, actions, and destiny.

Some agency hacks that I learnt today to be more agentic:

- **Find thing that you are willing to do that others aren't, often because they are annoying or unpleasant.** These are often the things that are most valuable, but also the things that are most likely to be overlooked.

- **Court rejection.** If you are not getting rejected often, you are not trying hard enough or you are not aiming high enough. Learn to absorb rejection and court it.

- **Seek real feedback.** Few people do it, but yet it's the most impactful. To get good feedback, provide a way for people to do it anonymously. Anything else create friction on the social level.

- **Increase your [luck surface layer](https://weichun.xyz/blog/luck)**. Cast a wide net by meeting new people, even if it random. You never know how an earlier acquaintance might help you in the future.

- **Assume everything is learnable.** Everything is learnable if you put in the time and effort. Even traits. Read a book, observe people, and practice.

- **Learn to love low status moat.** There will be a period of time where you actually suck when you are learning something new or did a life-changing decision. There are 2 option you can do

  - Cross silently - without the help of anyone. This is the most common way.
  - Cross loudly - with the help of others. Learn by doing.

  Prefer the later since it exponentially increase your learning speed.

- **Don't work too hard.** Work smart. Burn out is real. The company won't collapse without your work no matter how important you think that 1 particular feature or bugfix is. Take regular breaks before it's too late.
