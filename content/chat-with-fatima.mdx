Fatima is a senior software engineer at Yelp, and I recently had a chance to talk to her over a video call. Here are the takeaways from our chat:

## How did you arrive at Yelp?

- She studied computer science at UWaterloo and took 4 internships throughout her undergrad studies. This gave her **a lot of clarity on what she is interested in**, and she highly recommends students to explore their interests via internships.
- Spent 2 years at a trading firm but decided she did not enjoy working with the people, despite finding the problems interesting.
- Yelp is exciting because she got to take a lot of ownership of the projects she's involved in.

## What are some interesting things you are doing at Yelp?

- Learning about how features get rolled out to the public in a controlled manner.
- Learning about how to mitigate risk and downtime in a large-scale system.
- Learning how to think very quickly.

## Day-to-day life at Yelp?

- Early in her career, she spent 90% of her time actively involved in implementation and programming. However, as she went on to become a senior, more time is spent on architecting, meetings, and deciding project directions.
- Monday & Wednesday are no-meeting days so that people can focus on their work.

## What are some tips on networking?

- Yelp practices remote working, so it's hard for networking to happen organically.
- She recommends reaching out to other teams and asking for coffee chats to learn about what they are doing.

## What are some pieces of advice you would give to your younger self?

- **Strategize Politically (at least a little bit)**
  - Although considered taboo, politics play a big role, and knowing the right people and establishing relationships is key.
  - The higher you go, the more people you have to convince and have a good rapport with.
  - Focus on high-impact and high-visibility work; these projects can only be obtained if you have a good relationship with your manager.
- **Be a Nice Person**
  - People don't remember you for your technical skills, but your attitude instead.
  - Technical skills can be taught, but attitude cannot, so people with a bad attitude are very easy to replace.
  - Don't hoard knowledge; instead, actively share it.
  - Practice excellent communication skills.

## Life in Montreal and vibes

- Has European vibes.
- California has too high living costs, so she prefers to work remotely.
