I got myself a new year present today - it's a SFMTA citation.

I was on the route #1 bus towards Presidio, which is a typically quiet ride (1 point of why I love to work at Presidio). I was sitting in the back, and the bus was mostly empty then near the end of the route, a group of people got on the bus. People dressed in black with a printer on their belt üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. 1 officer went to the front and another to the back. Another lady was outside, presumably their manager to stop people from running away.

It was like a well coordinated operation you see in the movies.

They asked for ticket verification for everyone - I only had my MUNI day pass which I activated at that point, but they caught on. To be fair, it's my fault for not activating it when I board. So I didn't fight it.

We went off the bus to the side so that the bus can continue its route.

They asked me if I was an international student and were kind enough to give me warning instead of a fine. He then took a picture of my student ID and told me to activate my ticket before I board next time.

I was a bit shaken up, because I've never seen this before, but also appreciative that officers are very understanding.

One of the things that we discussed at work today was "Is money a good motivation to incentivize employees?"

Here are my thoughts: Money is a good motivation but not the only thing that motivates people. Yes a lot of things in life depends on money, but I feel that there are more important aspects to consider as well. For example, money aside (given that you have a good baseline), I like to work in a place where I get to be creative and have a good challenging problem to solve, at a place where I can grow in terms of soft skills with people I look up to.

Every now and then, I get to work on a project that I'm passionate about, and that's what keeps me going.

I think some role in sales might be different, but I'm not in sales so I can't speak for that.

Another thought I had: Wouldn't it be fun to have a 'random' hike in the week to catch up with friends? I like the idea of talking while walking a route with good sceneries. As long as it's not one where you are panting for air. I want to check out Presidio one day, and watch the sunset at the beach.

Looking for a map for Presidio if anyone did one üòä
