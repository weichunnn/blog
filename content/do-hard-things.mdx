Life is not supposed to be easy.

Do hard things because that's what makes life worth living.

Some examples from Sahil Bloom:
> - Wake up early
> - Get cold
> - Move fast
> - Lift heavy
> - Focus
> - Be present
> - Have difficult conversations

While it's hard to do these consistently, try doing them for 30 minutes for 30 days. That's a good start for a habit. Take pride in doing hard things. It's what makes you grow.
