I went to a tarot reading and this is what happened. 

I was walking in a local night market as usual on a Saturday when I realized that there's a new booth setup in the middle section. There was a guy and girl sitting behind a table with a sign that says "Tarot Reading". I've always been curious about tarot reading and I've never done it before so I decided to give it a try.

The woman asked me to sit down and she started **shuffling** the card. She asked me to think about a specific question that I want to ask and I did. I asked about my future outlook in terms of career abroad.

First she laid out of 22 cards and asked me to pick one. I later know this as the Major Arcana. She then laid out 10 cards and asked me to pick 3. This is the Minor Arcana. 

These was the cards that I picked

She then started to interpret the cards that I picked.

She said that I should try to keep work and personal life separate and that I may have troubles in dealing with conflict because I would always assume people are nice. 

I was a bit shocked because I did [try to assume the best in people](https://weichun.xyz/blog/trust-but-verify). So far I had not had any issues with it (I hope). 

She then said she is not worried about my skills but she suggested me to be more cautious of people around me in the future. 

I thanked her and left. I decided to take it with a grain of salt. 

It was an interesting experience because Tarot is not really psychic in nature but more of a introspection tool. It's a way to reflect on your life and your decisions.
