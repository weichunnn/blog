Some of my notes and key takeways from [How to be Successful](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful) by Sam Altman that I will look back in the future.

I am trying to build and ship more things this year (progress on [twitter](https://twitter.com/_weichunnn)) so that I can be more successful outside of work and have something to look forward to. These advices are very applicable to me and I hope it will help you too.

**1. Compound Yourself**

- I am willing to take as much time as needed between projects to find my next thing. But I always want it to be a project that, if successful, will make the rest of my career look like a footnote.

- Long-term thinking with a broad view of how different systems in the world are going to come together.

**2. Self-Belief**

- If you don’t believe in yourself, it’s hard to let yourself have contrarian ideas about the future. But this is where most value gets created.

- The more ambitious you are, the more the world will try to tear you down.

**3. Think Independently**

- I try to always listen to it with the assumption that it’s true, and then decide if I want to act on it or not.

- Thinking from first principles and trying to generate new ideas is fun, and finding people to exchange them with is a great way to get better at this.

**4. Get Good at “Sales”**

- Getting good at communication—particularly written communication—is an investment worth making.

- Look for small bets you can make where you lose 1x if you’re wrong but make 100x if it works.

**5. Take Risk**

> When people get used to a comfortable life, a predictable job, and a reputation of succeeding at whatever they do, it gets very hard to leave that behind (and people have an incredible ability to always match their lifestyle to next year’s salary).

- It’s easy—and human nature—to prioritize short-term gain and convenience over long-term fulfillment.

- Look for small bets you can make where you lose 1x if you’re wrong but make 100x if it works.

**6. Focus**

- It is much more important to work on the right thing than it is to work many hours. Most people waste most of their time on stuff that doesn’t matter.

**7. Work Hard**

- One of the great joys in life is finding your purpose, excelling at it, and discovering that your impact matters to something larger than yourself.

- Find work you like doing with people you enjoy spending a lot of time with.

**8. Be Bold**

- Follow your curiosity. Things that seem exciting to you will often seem exciting to other people too.

**9. Be Willful**

- [Ask for what you want](https://weichun.xyz/blog/ask-for-what-you-want). You usually won’t get it, and often the rejection will be painful.

**10. Be hard to compete with**

- The best way to become difficult to compete with is to build up leverage. For example, you can do it with personal relationships, by building a strong personal brand, or by getting good at the intersection of multiple different fields.

**11. Build a network**

- An effective way to build a network is to help people as much as you can.

- Develop a reputation for really taking care of the people who work with you

- Have a reputation for pushing people hard enough that they accomplish more than they thought they could, but not so hard they burn out.

- The easiest way to learn is just to meet a lot of people, and keep track of who goes on to impress you and who doesn’t.

**12. You get rich by owning things**

- You get truly rich by owning things that increase rapidly in value.

**13. Be internally driven**

- The most successful people I know are primarily internally driven; they do what they do to impress themselves and because they feel compelled to make something happen in the world.
