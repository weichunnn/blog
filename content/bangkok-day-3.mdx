summary: 
---

- Early morning ride to Pratunam market. We wanted to look for Auntie's Morning Porridge but it was closed by the time we reached there - 10am

- Walked around and ended up getting some coffee at a random cafe in front of First Hotel. This is surprisingly good. I don't think it has a name

- Had breakfast at McDonald's. They served pork burger here. I ordered the porridge but they didn't taste good. Malaysia's is miles better

- Tried weed coffee. Didn't taste anything

- Went through a lot of malls. GW made us walk 25 minutes to reach to the next place

- Tried Karun. They serve ice blended thai coffee. We searched up and down for this. One guy told us it was on 6th then someone tell us it was actually on the ground floor, while another told us it was on the 2nd floor. In fact, it was on the 3rd. We almost gave up but I think that's why it tasted so good

- YZ bought 18+ socks

- Sat on a TukTuk because it was too hot. He did an illegal U turn over 6 lanes of traffic. Drivers in Thailand are next level

- Tomyum in Pe Aor is phenomenal. They use coconut milk so it's not watery and it smells so good. The prawns are huge and fresh. The tom yam is so good. I think it's the best I've ever had

- Thailand don't serve water in a cup instead they serve the packaged bottled version

- Went for a fitting session at Boss Avenue. It's coming to life and I can't wait to see the final product

- YZ went back to the hotel because he's getting faded/headache

- A, GW and I went for a massage while waiting for YZ to recover. We went to a place called Urban Thai. We went for 1.5h consisting of 1h thai massage and 30 minutes of foot massage

- Thai massage really stretches your body. I remembered even going for a butterfly posses where you swing your hands to the side and the masseuse will pull you back. It felt so good after that

- We left the AirBnB keycard in the room and had no way up. Contacted AirBnB for help

- Dinner was at Som Som Seafood. We were lucky we came earlier by 5 minutes otherwise the queue would be long

- AirBnB did not get back. Realized that the owner's number is in the confirmation email. Called him and he came to help us

- Went back to Boss Avenue to collect the full suits. It's so so good. We took a picture of 4 of us. They even posted us on their Instagram page

- Route66 is lit. YZ treated us to a bottle of whiskey. We danced and had a good time. Best night ever

- A accidentally broke a glass from the opposite table. He offered a glass to compensate

- Fruit platter is actually mandatory there so we had to pay extra for it. Not too sure why?

- Met several Taiwanese guys who are like us. High school friends who are on a trip together. 台独, aoligei

- The night ended at 4.30am because the club closed

- The Bolt driver drove quicker because he was scared of us (I think). We were speaking in Malay throughout. Imagine 4 drunk guys speaking in Malay

- Round 2 of drinks in AirBnB. GW put on Manyao songs. We were all singing and dancing

- GW did push up on the floor

- Somehow we made it to bed
