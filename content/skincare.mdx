Recently, I was influenced by my friend to have a better skincare routine to have better skin when we are older. I did my research and found out that there are too many products in the market. But it's fun understanding the purpose of each product and how they work together to achieve the desired effect.

Here are some products that I eyed on and which I found useful. I am bias towards Korean products since I find them to be more effective.

1. [Anua Heartleaf Pore Control Cleansing Oil](https://anua.us/products/heartleaf-pore-control-cleansing-oil-200ml)
