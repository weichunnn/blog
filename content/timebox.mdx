The general idea that we need to be productive at every moment of our lives is a myth and is quite unachievable. What we can do is be attentive about it and be intentional with what we do. 

One technique that I have found useful is **timeboxing**. You allocate a fixed amount of time on your calendar to a task and try to complete it within that time. This allows you to focus deeply on that specific task, limit distractions and get shit done. I don't necessarily follow them to a tee but they give me a general idea of what I am doing now and next.

Another technique is **actively saying no**. When I take on a new thing or project, I would think about what I am potentially cutting off by taking this on. I would potentially need twice the amount of effort to get half of the result - if it's still worth it at this point in time, then it's a no brainer, otherwise, it's time to reevaluate.
