> You can predict the mood and behavior pattern of any chimp by the 5 chimps they hang out the most.

Not just chimps, we humans are the the same, How we think and behave are heavily influenced by those we surround ourselves with. If you spend time with lazy, unmotivated, negative, you are very likely to be the same. On the flip side, if you spend time with motivated, positive, and hardworking people, they will highly likely to rub off on you.

I think it's important to be very intentional of people you associate with. They form the very mind and habits that shapes your future. If you want to constantly challenge yourself and grow, you need to be around people who are doing what you want to and who are successful (based on your metrics of success). 

On the contrary, this doesn't mean you should cut off all of your friends who are not up to your level. I think friendship and personal growth can be a separate topic. I have a bunch of friends that I keep in contact till today and although they are all not in the same path as me, I still enjoy their company and I think they are good people.


So, choose your 5 chimps wisely. Some questions you can start asking yourself:

- Who am I currently surrounded with?
- Who do I want to be surrounded with?
