during the spring in Japan, there's 4 tree that blooms: Cherry, Plum, Peach, and Apricot. but they bloom at their own time and not together.
the Japanese philosophy of Oubaitori is a manifestation of this natural way: humans grow at their own pace. their growth and journey are unique and can't be replicated.
comparison is therefore a waste of energy. comparison is the thief of joy

i think sometimes i fall to this - thinking why i had not acheive this when other had? why can they....but i can't? it's difficult but i will try to be
more concious of it now and keep everything as just trying my best.
