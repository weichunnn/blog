Hosting an event and planning it well takes a lot of time and effort. It was when I started to plan for this hackathon that I start to appreciate the effort that goes into hosting.

Most of us rather attend and event then judge if there's enough food, if the wifi works etc, but we seldom appreciate the planning that does into it.

A, B and I decided to host a hackathon because we had a lot of leftover Claude credits from our Anthropic grant. We wanted to give it away to the community and we thought a hackathon would be a great way to do that. In particular one for high school students only.

This [guide by MLH](https://guide.mlh.io/general-information/hackathon-timeline) was very helpful.

We started the design on the [website](https://spicy-humor-656262.framer.app) today and I think it's slowly coming together. B did it with another of our friend, L which I think had one of the best taste in designs. L is also very down to earth and I think she's fun to talk to and hand out with.

Since prizes is one of the biggest draws for hackathons, we wanted to make sure we had some good ones. I was in charge of that department and I definitely want to make sure that we had some good ones. Some of them are: Ipad Mini, OpenAI/Claude subscription for 1 year, [3D printers](https://www.creality.com/products/ender-3-neo-3d-printer), Remarkable tablets, Oculus Quest 2, keyboards ([Rainy 75](https://www.wobkey.com/products/rainy75) / [Crush 80](https://www.wobkey.com/products/crush80)), and more.

Also thinking about Raspberry Pi starter kit since that was what caught my attention when first starting CS.

Well the hard part is now money since prizes cost a ton. I want to try to see if any companies are willing to sponsor in return for a place in the workshops and logo placement on the t-shirts. Otherwise, I might need to revise them.

I hope this goes well and I can get some good memories out of it.

p.s Tried out [Jina Bakes](https://www.jinabakes.com/) today and it's so so goooood!

p.s Thank L for helping out :)
