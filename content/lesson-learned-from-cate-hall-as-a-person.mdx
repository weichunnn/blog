Cate Hall is an amazing person and I came across a story from her husband describring her personality.

These are some of her traits that I think are very admirable and how she acts on them.

**1. Winging at life**

Internalize that everyone is almost just winging it in their life, so you should too. Lucky people fail too, so just believe in yourself and do it.

Approach smarter people and be open-minded, ask dumb questions, think from first principles, and always improve yourself.

Do something that seems very ambitious, and you will be surprised that it's actually possible.

**2. Data is Gold**

Know yourself, know your strengths and weaknesses, and know what you want. More importantly, know the people around you.

Having general knowledge makes it possible for you to connect with people. Do more reading and learnings on any topics you are interested in.

**3. Not knowing != Threat to you ego**

Learning shouldn't be tied to ego. People should be humble and accept that no one knows everything and should instead focus on working on those that they don't know.

**4. Working hard at life**

Cate's personality is not to be an automaton but to prefer becoming more human, i.e., attending fun events, feeding stray cats, etc.

Many people chase paychecks for boring reasons, or they fall into social games that make them boring. Instead, we should think about how we are spending this time as humans.

**5. Prestige and Social Status**

Don't pay more attention to high-status people and leave your close friends hanging.

> At some point, I realized there are certain games you can never win, and I resolved to stop playing those games.

**6. Being humble**

Take responsibility for what you do. However, don't be overly proud of your achievement or think less of people.

Cate's personality made her always credit her success to dumb luck and unusual circumstances althought truly it's because she's hardworking and smart.
