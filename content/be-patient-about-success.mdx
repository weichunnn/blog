> Sure I am that this day we are masters of our fate, that the task which has been set before us is not above our strength; that its pangs and toils are not beyond our endurance. As long as we have faith in our own cause and an unconquerable will to win, victory will not be denied us.

I got this quote from the book by Robin Sharma - [The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43877.The_Monk_Who_Sold_His_Ferrari). It was one one of the quote that was hung up on the wall of the Julian's (Robin's mentor) office.

This reminds me of something Arnold, my manager at work, said about being patient. 

"Are you willing to be patient and trust that success and recognition will come to you in time?". 

He told me that I am already performing at the next level but due to my short tenure being a full timer, HR was not convinced hence that resulted in the delay.

I was a little disappointed and frustrated at first. After some time, I gave more thought about to figure our why I was feeling that way.

And here's what I realized.

The path to success is not exactly linear, but tend towards a j-curve. It takes months and maybe years of hard work and dedication before you see the fruits of your labour. Comparing yourself with a linear path just set an unrealistic benchmark of progress and that can be demotivating.

What we need to do is to be patient, consistent and trust the process. Of course, make sure to check in with your progress and make adjustments along the way to keep you in the right path.
