One of the question I asked my manager today was "Are people in our team hungry enough?". Inspired by the movie [Hunger](https://www.netflix.com/title/81517155) on Netflix. This topic stemmed from the conversation I had with G where he mentioned about learnings plateau.

He thought about it briefly and then said 'No'.

He mentioned that people are often time **too focus on the problem itself and on how to solve it, but not on reaching out and understanding what other problems are there and which one to solve**. He advised that we should be **more proactive in reaching out** ie talking to other team and stakeholders to understand where the team is standing and how we best help them with limited resources.

These are the things that gets you to do impactful work (or in another way, to be promoted). Technical prowess is important, but it's fall behind in terms of the softer side of engineering ie communication, empathy, and understanding the business.
