Something people have recently asked me is, "Is it worth taking such a big risk?" The context behind this question is about my decision to leave my job and move to San Francisco for graduate school.

I've given this some deep thought, and my answer to that question is "Yes, it is worth it."

I agree big risks are not for everyone. I'm referring to those crazy, long-shot ideas that may or may not change your entire life trajectory: like moving to another country, starting your own business, marrying someone, etc.

For me, at this stage of my life, I have fewer responsibilities and commitments. Hence, I can afford to **fail when it's easier to fail**. This is an important point. Taking on risk is not just about being gung-ho and showing off that you can do it, but more about being able to handle the consequences of failure.

So, the next time you have a crazy idea, think about if you can afford to fail. If you can, then by all means go for it.

On the contrary, I also agree that with more experience and resources, these big-risk items may be more feasible. But it might be harder to justify giving up the things you own in the future. Life's trajectory is typically harder to change as you get older.

I cannot predict my future in SF, but one thing I know is I will work my ass off to maximize my surface area for success. I will make it public as to whether this big risk I took is worth it.
