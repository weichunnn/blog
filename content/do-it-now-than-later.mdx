A lot of times you would put off doing something easy because you think you would just do it later. But you never do. This happened to me as well.

[Gretchen Rubin ](https://gretchenrubin.com/2006/12/need_a_simple_a/) has a simple solution to this problem, called the one-minute rule. **If you can do it in less than a minute, do it now.**

Some ways of applying this rule are like:

- Replying to email or text messages if it is a simple yes/no question or scheduling a date
  
- Doing simple household chores like putting away the dishes, throwing away the trash, or making your bed
