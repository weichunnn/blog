It was 10pm MYT, and I led my first introductory call for my team with a 3rd-party vendor - [Starburst Galaxy](https://www.starburst.io/).

Starburst is a managed [Trino](https://trino.io/) service that acts as a general query engine. It can connect to multiple different sources and perform the necessary computation.

In that call, I liked the other side's line of inquiry and really felt that he was trying to help both sides succeed. **Which I think is the key to a successful partnership.**

Here are some of the content we went through which could be helpful for those who are managing new customer accounts:

- Self-introduction
- Who are the main consumers of the data? And how many of them are there?
- What are the main use cases for data?
- What's the current data architecture, and why are you looking into this product?
- What are the key things you prioritize or evaluate for new tools?
- What is the timeline for implementation?
- InfoSec and compliance requirements, i.e., SOC2
- Pricing between managed and self-hosted
- Support plan expectations
- Monitoring and alerting such as DataDog integration
- Follow up steps for next week

Some of the things I will do better with similar calls:

- Prepare a generic introduction for the team and the company
- Prepare questions related to the discussion topics
- Limit the amount of information you give out (i.e., don't mention if you are only evaluating one company) and try to get the other side to talk more
