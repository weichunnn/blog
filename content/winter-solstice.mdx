The Winter Solstice, also known as the Dongzhi Festival, is the shortest day and longest night of the year. It's an important festival, often overshadowed by its counterpart, the Lunar New Year ðŸ§¨.

This season marks a turning point in the annual calendarâ€”a time when yin (cold, dark) energy transitions to yang (light, positive) energy as the days begin to get longer again. During this time, families gather to eat tangyuan (glutinous rice balls) and celebrate the past year's hard work and togetherness. Tangyuan, due to its round shape, symbolizes reunion and togetherness.

My family and I celebrate this festival yearly by rolling tangyuan, cooking them and then eating them together. It's a time where we are together in the same place, sharing stories and just enjoying each other's company.
