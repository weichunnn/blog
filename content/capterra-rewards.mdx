I received more capterra campaign emails today. After 1 year of not receiving any.

The campaign is pretty simple and it's quite a bang for your ~~buck~~ time.
1 review of a product gives you about **$5 or $10 USD** and it won't take much time too. Plus it's **anonymous**.

The downside is that it depends on the campaign they run and when they do it.
