Capterra's rewards is pretty simple and gives you quite a bang for your ~~buck~~ time.
1 review giving you about $5 or $10 USD and it won't take much time too. Plus it's anonymous.

The downside is that it depends on the campaign they run. I recently receive this email after 1 year of not receiving any.

A look into [Capterra](https://www.capterra.com/p/19319/JIRA/reviews/), there are actually quite a number of reviews per product and they are all genuinev - giving you a sense about its pros and cons.
I wonder do people actually review it for the rewards or they are just genuinely happy with the product.

If you are a broke student like me, definitely take this opportunity to earn some extra moo-lah.
