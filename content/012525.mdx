Went on a hike today at Angel Island and we did the Perimeter Trail. It was a 5.5 mile hike and it took us about 2.5 hours to complete.

It didn't start off well because the ferry was an hour late, so we just stood in the cold wind at the port for an hour. But once we got to the island, it was all good. The weather was perfect for a hike and the views were amazing. I was surprised that this is only a 30-minute ferry ride from the city.

The hike wasn't really steep, it was mainly flat ground with some ups and downs. We were taking pictures and chatting along the way, and also playing silly games like 'What words end with -ball?'.

L bought a lot of snacks and cherry tomatoes for the hike. I think she's the most prepared one out of all of us. I only brought a bottle of water and a pack of trail mix.

M and H are fun people. They are always laughing and making jokes. I think they are the life of the party. I'm glad I met them. The funny thing is I met H (I have his contact) before this at another party, but we forgot who each other was. It's funny how we tried to figure out how we met and what we talked about.

I didn't really talk to N a lot today, but I think she would be an interesting person to talk to because she had a lot of fun stories to share.

Legs are sore now, but it was a good day. I like these hikes.
