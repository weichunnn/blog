> A minimal dragon logo designed with continuous lines, forming an abstract yet recognizable shape. The dragon should appear to be in motion, with a modern gradient effect while retaining traditional details like whiskers and horns

Finished the [prospectus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YAtPc0vmepKfy5_UP0XsnNJ-Sua6MR8UZsRW7BTdTng/edit?usp=sharing) for the hackathon I am hosting. And I am pretty happy with the result for the time I spent. I am not a great designer or anything but I hope the content tells a story.

Claude helped a lot in refining my drafts. OpenAI and [Bing](https://copilot.microsoft.com) for building the logo. I used ChatGPT to come up with prompts e.g "Write 5 best prompts for a dragon logo, simple and minimalistic, focus on modern design with traditional aspects". Then for each prompt, I paste it into Bing to generate images. To my surprise, Bing is quite tasteful in its selection.

From there, I used Canva to add text, edit, shape the logo etc. Finally, export as a PNG and upload it.

No need to pay for any tooling or use one of the many logo generators that's stuck behind a paywall.
