I read some posts/articles about friendships today and began to evaluate where I am in the journey of friendship. Here's the one I resonated with - [the practice of friendship](https://tasshin.com/blog/the-practice-of-friendship/?curius=1417)

## Key takeaways:

- Friends are people with whom you share common ground - where interest and trust are mutual.
- Your character is a reflection of the five closest people around you.
- Friendships can be built online, so don't limit yourself to only those in close proximity.
- Don't approach another person with a specific label or role; allow the relationship to grow naturally.
- Deepening friendships can be fast-tracked by:
  - Increasing contact (through collaboration, messages, etc.)
  - Having a semi-structured purpose (something to talk about by default, a reason why you both became friends, such as learning new things?)
  - Sharing vulnerabilities.
- Maintain friendships by always letting them know when you think of them:
  - Remembering birthdays (keeping track of their birthdays two months in advance is a good way to not forget and also things they like).
  - Sending short messages.
  - Organizing impromptu catch-ups.
- Take more pictures together:
  - Consider compiling a photo album for the year to reflect on the journey with the people you met.
- Many friends or Less friends
  - Tradeoff of surface level versus deep relationship
  - Depends on the end goal what you are comfortable with.
- Three common types of friends. There's a place an time for each - 2 person having different idea of what their relationship is can lead to disappointment.
  - Friends of pleasure.
  - Friends of utility.
  - Friends of virtue (Best of the 3 because they lift people up in term of life values, but hard to achieve because it takes a long time).

## What I want to improve on:

- Explore community on Twitter to find like-minded people.
- Regularly message old friends to just catch up (with pure intentions).
- Try to become slightly more extroverted by a degree or two and **initiate small talks**. (I find I like doing things / keeping thoughts to myself, which prevents me from meeting new people and making new friends)
- Attend networking events.
