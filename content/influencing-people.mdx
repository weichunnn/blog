Being a useful person and having to grow together is important and fulfilling.
Here are some tips to do it from a technical background.

1. Share useful tools

Share tools that have helped you become more productive or solve problems.
From my experience, people are always highly appreciative of new things that could help in their daily work.

2. Share references

Share internet blogs, articles, and documentation that have helped you solve a problem or learn something new.

3. Tell a chronological story

Share past experiences, focusing on what happened and what you learned from them.

4. Show hidden things

Reveal insights or techniques that might not be obvious to others but are highly useful.
Like how SQL queries may not work in the order you expect it to be.

5. Demo a confusing tools

Build a tool that explains how another tool works.
