It's July! I'm here. I touched down in the Bay Area finally after years of talking about it.

There's so many things I want to do, so many things that I want to achieve. With this change of environment, I hope to be able to do more, to be more. No more restrictions, no more excuses, just pure 'D' gear and go.

I am reminded of a quote from Paul Arden

> "It‚Äôs Not How Good You Are, It's How Good You Want to Be."

Being in SF really motivates me to be better. People around me are so driven, so passionate about what they do. You have founders, engineers, designers, artists, left, right and center. It's a melting pot of creativity and innovation. So having these people around me, I can't help but feel inspired.

To do that means I have to keep myself accountable and set goals throughout this 1 year. Some of the main highlights are:

- **Meeting new people and making new friends** - at least 1 new person a day?
- **Attend a lot and a lot of tech events** (there's so many happening everyday)
- Travel and hike around (I really needed this Airconds weather)
- **Build and launch a product** (YC S25 üöò üçæ)
- **Read and write consistently**
- Build a habit of exercising consistently
- Cooking

I'm excited for what's to come. I'm excited for the journey ahead. If you are also in SF, hit me up! I would love to meet you :)
