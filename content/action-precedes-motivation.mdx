Realistically, this makes sense. If you wait for motivation to come, you might be waiting for a long time. It's like waiting for the perfect moment to start something. 

The perfect moment doesn't exist. You just have to start.

For me, I've been wanting to write for so long. But I always lose the motivation after the first piece. Now, I just decided to write. I don't care if it's good or bad. I just want to write. And I'm doing it. I'm writing. And I'm happy about it.

p.s This is the first time I see Grant Sanderson's face. And he looks so young.
