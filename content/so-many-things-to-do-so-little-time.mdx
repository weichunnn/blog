It's 3 AM, and I've just ended a Discord call with two friends in the U.S.

These days have been busy, filled with numerous hackathons and developing a startup idea for our graduate school applications.
Due to time zone differences, our calls usually happen at midnight for me and very early in the morning for them.

I'm starting to wonder if I'm burning myself out.
However, part of me insists that this grind is worth it and that I should keep pushing every day, believing that the reward lies in the process itself.
With that in mind, I realize I should prioritize some projects over others instead of trying to tackle everything simultaneously.

I enjoy building things with them because they not only teach me new things but also contribute to my personal growth.
This collaboration also fits one of my goals: to build a startup with my best friend and, perhaps, make it big.

We'll see how things unfold, but I'm committed to managing my time effectively to avoid burnout. I'm not giving up just yet.

If only I have more time...
