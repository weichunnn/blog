Laufey is one of the new artists I've recently discovered, and I've completely fallen in love with her music.

The harmony from her jazzy voice and the classical instruments background complements each other so well. They made me feel so calm while listening to them.

You can also tell that the stories she tells through her music are drawn from her own experiences and are highly relatable.
