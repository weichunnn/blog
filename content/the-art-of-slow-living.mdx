Most of our lives, we live in the hustle and bustle of the city, chasing the dream we always want. But do we actually stop and think on what we are doing? Are we living the life as what we wanted it to be?

The art of slow living tells us to just slow down. Take a step back and live in the 'now'. Appreciate and experience the things that happen around us. Why rush when we can take our time and enjoy the moment?

Things you can do while slowing down:

1. Ask yourself this: What do **you** want to do? What is the **ideal life** for you?

2. Stop comparing yourself to others. It may serve as a motivation but most of the time, you are unique in your own way and you may even excel more than them.

3. Try things out. [Pursue experience rather than material things](https://www.becomingminimalist.com/experiences/). Maybe you will sink more money but those are worth it!
