> 子曰。學而不思則罔、思而不學則殆。
> The Master said: “To study and not think is a waste. To think and not study is dangerous.”

A saying from Confucius.

Read whenever you can and as much as you can. It's a good habit to have. You soon realize that it makes you
an interesting person to talk to and you can demonstrate understanding that joins insights from various domains together.
As opposed to a smart person that does not read, they can only talk about specifics but not express ideas or references or follow through with the chain of logic they have.

I write these days to pen down my thoughts on what I read. Hoping to learn more by thinking.

Even though reading takes quite some time, I think it's non-negotiable.
I'm not a fast reader, but I'm trying to be a better one. And I am trying to stick to it by setting
a certain time block in my day just for reading daily.
