Some days when I sleep early, I also wake up earlier at 5am.

I don't know why, but I feel like I have less energy when I wake up at 5am compared to when I wake up at 7am. I needed an additional 30 - 40 minutes to ramp up my energy levels before I can start focusing.

Then, energy usually slumps after lunch, so I take a nap. But my naps are 1 hour long haha! Power naps are supposed to be 20 minutes long, but I tried and this only works if I'm really really tired.

I went to Costco today and I am surprised a 2-3 weeks' grocery is ~110 dollars. But it's just 8 items ðŸ¥².

Why are groceries so expensive!

I got some Char Siew from Costco. I was surprised they have it all vacuum packed and you just need to heat it up. I was planning to make it myself, but I guess I can try this first.
