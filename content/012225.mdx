It feels so much different when you end the day with something.

Recently, I started a part time job with [InkLink](https://www.inklink.com/). It had been a fun journey so far - developing features, iterating, building, then reiterating, doing experiments and so on.

Since this is a practicum attach to my graduate program, I only work on Mondays and Wednesdays since those are the days that I have no classes. It's only 2 days yes, but because of that I also have to keep the team updated on progress and not block any dev work while I'm not in. That means finishing the feature I'm building or putting enough documentation so my teammate can continue on.

That's why, everyday, I try to leave with something done, an accomplishment, no matter how small or how big. This also applies to any days outside of work. It gives me a sense that today is not wasted.

During the night, while writing this blog, I think to myself, what did I get done today? Am I satisfied? What could be better?
