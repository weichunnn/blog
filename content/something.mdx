When I'm working, I like to listen to music to calm all the noisy surrounding me. It helps me to focus and concentrate on my work.

Depending on the type of the work I am doing, I will choose different playlist.

For example, if it's something that require full concentration, I will listen to [music without lyrics](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0DuJpUcHov9nNbfpDzdAK7?si=1dfa8ea2d0ba488c) or [music in a foreign language](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2Cm9ajh6kZDCA5cmgMlllh?si=5c0a0610887149f4) that I don't understand. If it's something like reading, I like listening to slow/jazzy songs like [Laufey](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1EIWCJohaHcLid?si=c8aa5c3d15dc4505). 

I'm still curating my playlist so if you have any recommendations, feel free to share with me!
