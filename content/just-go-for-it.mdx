Have you ever had the thought where you realize that you had an idea, felt excited about it, told your friends about it, then say you'll do it, but never actually do it?

I had. Many times. Too many.

I had many ideas or things to do every day like wanting to take care of a plant, trying out the gym, learn cooking and many more. But I always say I am going to do it soon, and in the end I forget about it. And the whole cycle repeats itself again.

[Rajiv Surendra](https://youtu.be/1bdMV8PxnFE?si=3QGsBqoOsoJmj5z7&t=876) in his own words said this and I think this is a good reminder for me and for you.

> Always go for it always try if you have the inspiration to make something if you
> don't know how to make it but you're just intrigued maybe you saw something out there in the real world or you saw something in a book just go for it. And even if it doesn't work out usually it was fun trying maybe you spent some money that went down the drain but the money was spent on the process it was spent on the actual action.

[Most people won't](https://bryce.vc/post/64889707700/most-people-wont) do it, that means they are probably also facing the same dillema as you, where you think you won't make it or you are not good enough. Which means if you change your mindset and just do it, you will be **ahead of 99% of the people**.

p.s From this, I took some change and registered myself for a [marathon](https://raceroster.com/events/2024/82409/kl-city-day-half-marathon-2024) + ordered an [orchid sapling](https://shopee.com.my/%F0%9F%94%A5PHALAENOPSIS-ANAK-POKOK-LIVE-PLANT%F0%9F%94%A5MIN-PEMBELIAN-5-i.66075374.6456140319) (I hope it can survive my care, updates later!).
