Influence is about getting people to do what you want them to do **without feeling like they are being forced to do it**.

To be a great leader, you will need to be able to influence people since they will be the ones executing the vision you have in mind. For example, a staff engineer in a company doesn't do a lot of coding, instead they focus on propagating their ideas and standards to the rest of the organization.

Influence is a combination of **Likability** and **Credibility**. Likability is about how much people see you as a person, and credibility is about how much people trust you.

This year I am working on likability by meeting someone new every week and building a relationship with them. I am also working on credibility by being more consistent with my work and participating in more design projects.
