Recently, I started watching [The Bear](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14452776/). It tells a story of how a young chef tries to upscale his own sandwich shop through all the hardships and people issues.

I appreciated the show because it showed me what goes on behind the scene in the kitchen of a successful restaurant. It also showed me how a chef can be so passionate about his food, and how he can be so meticulous about the details of his food, all while needing to be tolerate the stress that comes with it.

My favorite episode is from Season 2 Episode 6. It portrayed so much behind each character's past and allowed me to really understand why they are the way the are. Although it may be a bit chaotic at times, it reminded me of how a family still sticks together at the end of the day.

Another one is from Season 2 Episode 4 where Luca shared about how he got so good. I think this is a piece of wisdom that we all can learn where not everything is a competition.

> I think as I started early, I got my skill set up really quick and then started to feel like I was really the best, you know, like at all these really good places
> I really was the best cook.
> And then I started at this really great place as a commie, and this other chef started the same day as me. And I thought we were competition,
> but, really, we weren't. He was better than me, much, much better than me.
> He worked harder and faster than I ever could.
> **And it was the first time I realized that I wasn't the best
> and I was never going to be the best. So I started looking at it like it was a good thing, like at least I knew who the best was now and I could take that pressure off myself.
> And the only logical thing to do is to try and keep up with him.**
> So I never left this guy's side. I got better than I ever thought I possibly could be just from trying to keep up with him.
