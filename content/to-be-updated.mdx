Hermeus is a startup building hypersonic (not supersonic) planes for the future. I find them quite interesting because they aimed to achieve the impossible (speed above Mach 5 has not been achieved since the 1960s) and they are not afraid to fail.

I think that's something good we can all take away. 

Everybody is bound to fail, it's just a matter of time. If you are moving fast, you should prepare for failure so you can recover faster. In the startup world, this is more than just a good-to-have. It's a must-have.
