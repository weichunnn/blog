Recently, I was doing a lot of research on clothes to buy before I head off to the US. And I realized that **minimalism and simplicity** are more of my style. Think of more neutral and plain colors dress up.

These clothes are just easier to match with each other and I don't have to think too much about what to wear everyday. Put on a white shirt, flannel/outerwear, black pants, and white sneakers and I'm good to go.

Korean have a term for this kind of style called "모던캐주얼" which translates to modern casual. It's a style that's simple, clean, and comfortable. It's not too flashy or loud, but it's not boring either. It's just right.

I also like how they layer their clothes. It's like they're playing with different textures and lengths to create a more interesting look. More towards styling your clothes instead of just wearing it.

These days, when buying clothes, I also tend to look for quality over quantity. I'd rather spend more on a piece that I really like and will last me a long time than buy a lot of cheap clothes (from my experience, the colors or cloth don't last more than 1 year)

Nevertheless, clothes is just one part of you and ultimately, how you present yourself is the key.
