> If you just get up every morning and keep plugging and have some discipline and keep learning…it's amazing how it works.

> And if I enjoy learning it, I regard it as important, because I think that’s what you’re here for, is to go to bed every night a little wiser than you were when you got up.

The best people in the world never stop learning. They are a lifelong students.

Charlie Munger is a good example.

Even at his old age, he continuously learns to bring more opportunities into Berkshire. His [$232 million deal on BYD](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-sells-1-million-more-byd-shares-2023-1#:~:text=Berkshire%20Hathaway%20initially%20purchased%20its,shares%20for%20about%20%24232%20million.) back in 2010 is a testament to this, where he and Warren dove into the EV business before most of the industry.

The reason to keep learning is also simple: the world keeps on changing, your competitors keep on learning, so the only way to catch up is to keep learning. It's also a way for you to see the world in a new light when you understand certain knowledge.

Some takeaways from the speech:

- When you are around people who are more experienced and have a lot of value to offer, pick their brains as much as you can.
- Practice multi-disciplinary learning. Learn everything from any domain, and it will make life more fun and rich.
- Shine your light on your clients first, then your boss, then on yourself. Make people feel like they are the smartest person in the room.
