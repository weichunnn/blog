> In the shooter hypothesis, a good marksman shoots at a target, creating a hole every ten centimeters. Now suppose the surface of the target is inhabited by intelligent, two-dimensional creatures. Their scientists, after observing the universe, discover a great law: “There exists a hole in the universe every ten centimeters.” They have mistaken the result of the marksman’s momentary whim for an unalterable law of the universe. The farmer hypothesis, on the other hand, has the flavor of a horror story: Every morning on a turkey farm, the farmer comes to feed the turkeys. A scientist turkey, having observed this pattern to hold without change for almost a year, makes the following discovery: “Every morning at eleven, food arrives.” On the morning of Thanksgiving, the scientist announces this law to the other turkeys. But that morning at eleven, food doesn’t arrive; instead, the farmer comes and kills the entire flock.

The idea that the universe's laws, constants that we know in physics ie Speed of Light, Planck constant could be the occurrence of some random events is terrifying.

Are we just beings living in the ruined dimension of the 4th dimension which is the ruined dimension of the 5th etc. etc. etc.?

In short, we cannot totally assume what we see locally to be necessarily true globally ie the universe because it could be an event only specific to our current situation. This is also one of the problem faced when we try to [reason by induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_induction).
