Vegetarians are people who do not eat animal meats.

Vegetarianism can be further categorized into minor groups:

- Lacto-ovo vegetarians: Avoid meat but consume eggs and dairy.
- Lacto vegetarians: Avoid meat and eggs but consume dairy.
- Ovo vegetarians: Avoid meat and dairy but consume eggs.

Vegans are people who do not eat animal flesh, animal products, or animal by-products.

Most vegans or vegetarians adopt this diet for religious beliefs, health reasons, or ethical reasons.
Although many studies show that [vegans are on average weaker](https://www.insider.com/vegans-have-weaker-bones-nutrient-rich-diet-can-help-2021-3), the healthiness of the diet really depends
on the plants they eat to supplement the nutrients typically obtained from proteins.

Interesting categories include:

- Pescatarians: Do not eat animal flesh except for fish.
- Flexitarians: Mostly vegetarian but occasionally eat meat.
