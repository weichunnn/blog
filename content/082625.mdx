been thinking a lot about money and career recently since i started my first job in the US.

i see coming to the US as being a game changer in career and a potential to earn tons of money since the tech scene here is booming, but how do people balance that with
job satisfaction? i see it's often one of the other: the people is good, the work is perfect, money is good. you get to choose 2 of 3.

i have a goal in mind now of what i want to achieve - it seems like a stretch goal but I want to try to get as close to that. so that means reiterating on my decisions and gravitating towards that
