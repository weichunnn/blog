> It's important to remember that discipline is not about being perfect or never giving into temptation. It's about committing yourself and following through on it, even when it's hard.

Discipline is the bridge on how we can maintain a proper life routine and make each day predictable. But it's something hard to do because of the devil on the other side tempting us to just be lazy.

One way to develop discipline that helped me is through daily practice. Do one thing only on the day you don't have motivation to do anything; just do it anyways no matter how scrappy it is. As long as you keep the momentum going, you'll eventually get better at it.

Start by something small. For example, I started writing daily by allocating 1 hour a day, and gradually I reduced that time slot as I got more and more comfortable writing. By consistently doing it, I've developed a habit of writing daily that doesn't require a motivation hence dreadful effort to do so.

The next time you are unmotivated, just remind yourself discipline unlocks success. Focus on being incrementally better than yesterday.
