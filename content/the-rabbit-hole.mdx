[The Rabbit Hole](https://arc.net/l/quote/cqecvutu) is a newsletter I found recently and it inspired me to find hidden gems like this.

It covers so many different aspect that we don't really think about in our day to day.

I liked how the author sub-categorized different domains and you learnt so much from just reading them. Although each unrelated, it's part of [multidisciplinary learning](https://weichun.xyz/blog/on-charlie-munger-and-learning) that Charlie Munger talked about.

This is the kind of things we should read. If you have more, I love to know!

p.s It's super cheap to subscribe too!
p.s Maybe I should start a substack of my own with the things I read
p.s Hmm I probably should
