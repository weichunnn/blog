I recently had an idea to plant something and take care of them. Orchids are really beautiful and I thought it would be a good idea to plant them.

Here are some of my notes prior to purchasing them.

Orchids are plants that **last a long time**, ranging from a week to a month. They usually **bloom only once or twice a year**.

They are **epiphytes** - they **don't grow on soil** but instead they grab moisture from the air. So they need to be planted in a **well-drained** potting mix. For example, orchid bark is a good one.

Remember **no direct sunlight** (around 55 to 70 degrees) and **don't overwater**. **Water once a week (not at the leave) and let the water drain out**.

To keep moisture in the air, add gravel to a tray of water and place the pot on top.

Fertilize with water soluble fertilizer, preferably **fertilizer with high nitrogen content once monthly**. If possible, dilute the content by half. After a week of 2, water with plain water to flush out the unused residues.

Use dry sheet moss for aesthetics.
