retool have a big poker and mahjong community and today it's poker tournament night. it was as real as it can get.
$20 buy in with professional dealers dealing ~20 players across 2 tables. blinds doubles every 15 minutes till the last hand.
i was no poker or statistic expert but I joined in to figure out how the game was played. it was at a point where i vaguely
remember which hand is bigger.

on my first hand, I got an A, K suited cards. I didn't know this was a really good starting pair and threw it in early (found out about it later).
the game goes very aggresive quickly with multiple all ins during the games. R got really lucky with multiple AK hands. L got really lucky
when she got all 4 Queens in the river! I busted out when I went all in in 1 hand but lost to an ace hight. in restospect it wasn't a great move haha!
when i bought in again, i got more cautious and only playing on hands with at least a pair. in the final round, i got AK again and decided to bet on it,
but unfortunately lost.

it's fun overally though - figuring out whether to make that bet depends on luck, thinking if another person is bluffing or not, thinking how good your hands are.
$40 dollars down but had tons of fun!
