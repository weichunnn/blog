One thing that had helped me the most is time-blocking. Instead of letting my brain go wild on doing something, I managed time by setting a fixed period for things I do.

For example, if I were working on a task/debugging at work, my default would be 2 - 4 hours (for small tickets) before I reach out for help. 

It's one of those thing where I know at the end of the time block, my brain productivity will fall into [diminishing returns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns). So I would stop and ask for help. Or I will just work on another thing and come back to it later.
