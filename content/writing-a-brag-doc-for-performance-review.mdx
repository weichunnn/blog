I had my first performance review at work today. It went well and here's my reflection on it.

Writing a brag document and reflecting on them had helped me a ton during this session. A brag document is a document where you 'brag' about all the things you've done and accomplished. This should be updated quite frequently and the interval can be decided by you (either weekly or monthly). Don't leave it till the end of the quarter or the year to write since you likely won't remember all the things that happened.

> Remember the 80/20 rule. 80% of outcomes (or outputs) result from 20% of all causes (or inputs) for any given event.

A format I followed is inspired by [this article](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/). I included my exact template and an example of what I wrote for each section.

## Brag Doc

1. **Major Accomplishments & Projects.** Specify the major project as well as the impact it had on the company.

   - Production-ize EMR v6 based on docker architecture. I was responsible for the research on EMR architecture, evaluation between the different spark-submit methodology, setting up unit/integration test framework as well as integrating CI/CD pipelines. The ground work done here helps engineers to build extensible spark pipelines ie DP3.

2. **Collaboration & Mentorship.** Describe how you've helped others and how you've collaborated with others.

   - I regularly help other engineers in areas where I have developed expertise, such as infrastructure-related domains, Kubernetes, AWS, Spark, Airbyte, and OMD. This has provided me the opportunity to uphold code quality (adhering to best practices) and disseminate knowledge.
   - Mentored S in the planning and implementation of the Snowflake Terraform module upgrade project.

3. **Design & documentation.** Describe how you've improved the design and documentation of the project.

   - Wrote design document for source column ingestion from upstream producers, which is a key initiative to be implemented in the following quarter

4. **Skills Development.** Describe how you've improved your skills in both technical and soft domain.

   - Kafka and CDC infrastructure.
   - How to mentor and guide other engineers on their tasks.
   - How to plan and scope big projects into manageable chunks.

5. **Positive Feedback.** Include positive feedback from others.

   - Recognized by the team for resolving and taking ownership of the XXX ETL incident that caused significant data delays I helped in brainstorming fixes that we could implement in the short term, calculating resource bump ups needed and finally planning and deployment. I also contributed in providing long term solutions to this particular pipeline

6. **Goals for next year.** Think and write about what you want to accomplish next year.

   - Mentoring and guiding more junior engineers on the team.
   - Own and lead at least 1 large initiative end-to-end.
   - Be involved in at least 1 cross-pod initiative.

## Review Session

Here are some of the talking points as well as the examples that I had with my manager during the session.

1. **Likes / Wins**

- I like mentoring and guiding junior engineers, seeing them getting unblocked is satisfying.
- I like planning and collaborating on vague problems - itâ€™s challenging but rewarding.

2. **Dislikes / Challenges**

- Tech debts: Allocate time to review tech debts and resolving them, instead of accumulating to the end of quarter.
- Moving fast: Look into managed option of a product for POC before putting a lot of time into deploying open source. Clarifying requirements with customers before building.
- Disassociation with business value: How to tie the work we are doing with business value as a metric to incentives team members?

3. **Going Forward**

- Be in charge of an intern/junior.
- Cross pod initiative and be involved in pod-based discussions.
