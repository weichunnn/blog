There are many apps out there that helps you track habits. Most of them claims that 21 days of streak helps you form a habit. But I think that might not be a good way to look at it.

Here's why. If you break that habit for a day, just because of how life works, you might feel like you have to start all over again. This can be discouraging. To the point that you might just give up.

However, if you look at cultivating habits, not as a streak, but something long term, this may be more achievable. You can have a bad day, but you can always come back to it the next day. You are encouraged to keep going as long as you are in an upward trend.

It's not about the streak, but about the consistency. A good example of this is [Polar Habits](https://polarhabits.com/).
