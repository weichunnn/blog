During my last one on one with my manager today, A asked me if I was tired everyday from working on so many things in and outside of work. 

My reply to him was that "Sometimes I am, but most of the time I'm not. I'm just bored."

I think that's the beauty of working on things that you are generally interested in. You get this endless energy and sense of fulfillment to drive you to do more. And in tech, there's just always something new to learn and work on.

Curiosity is my main driver to always look for new things and understand them. Everyday, there's this gap in my brain that I need to connect in order for things to make sense. Lacking that feels like I am only getting 1 side of the picture. 

Of course, there are days when I feel like I'm just going through the motions and not really learning anything new. But I think that's just part of the process so I am content with it.
