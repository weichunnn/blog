I initially saw this quote on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38123595) where people congratulated others by saying `Congratulations on your first Hug of Death!` and I didn't really understood it.

What it really refers to is:

> When you show-off your site in a public forum and it gets so much traffic that it crashes.

**Hug** - From people showing interest

**Death** - Application crash

Some ways of preparing for HoD prior to Show HN:

- Serverless
- Caching
- Pre-rendering ie Cloudflare edge
- CDN for assets
- Running extensive load tests
