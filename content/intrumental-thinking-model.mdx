I've been trying to think of a way to live life more intentionally, and I think I've found a good model to do so. These are some questions that I internalized recently and constantly ask myself:

- What do you want to get out of this?
- How will you measure your progress?
- What's the next step?
- What's the limiting factor?

Also, knowing your motivation is doing so is important. Ask yourself **WHY WHY WHY**? **WHAT** is it for? **HOW** does this help me? For example, writing daily forces me to allocate time to read and think, which helps me to grow myself culturally and link cross domain ideas.
