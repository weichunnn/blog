Some of the apps that I personally swear by and like on Mac.

I found these tools either on Hacker News or Product Hunt. Some of them are also recommended by friends.

- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) - better spotlight
- [Amie](https://amie.so) - calendar app similar to cron
- [Arc](https://arc.net/) - better browser with customizations
- [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) - terminal but better control with cursors
- [Bear](https://bear.app/) - note taking
- [Mos](https://mos.caldis.me/) - smooth scrolling
- [Fig](https://fig.io/) - terminal autocomplete with bunch of plugins
- [Breaktimer](https://breaktimer.app/) - reminder to take break from work
- [Batfi](https://micropixels.software/batfi) - protect battery from overcharging
- [AppCleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/) - clean up apps when uninstalling
- [PrettyClean](https://www.prettyclean.cc/) - clean up desktop
- [OwlOCR](https://owlocr.com/) - OCR tool to extract text from screenshots
