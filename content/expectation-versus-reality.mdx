I had a chat with one of my friend from work today. One of things that we talked about was how we often time have so many things we want to do but reality doesn't really let us do it. A lot of factors come into play, like time, money, and energy. If you are a international working in a foreign country, most of the time you have to think about sending money back home (& visa), so your goals have to be aligned to work hard to earn money. Not much risk taking can be done.

I do think being born with the right environment and resources can make a huge difference in what you can achieve. Not to say you cannot achieve anything if you are not born with a silver spoon in your mouth, but it's just that the path is much harder. Sometimes, luck plays a huge role.

At the end of the day, knowing what you want and working towards that will be the best thing you can do. It's not easy, but it's worth it.
