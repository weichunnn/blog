"I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times." - Bruce Lee

This is very much applicable to career as well. You will be average if you try to learn everything and be the best in everything. Time is unfortunately finite. 

Of course, you don't want to be a 1 trick pony because that limits your options and opinions. Try a few things and identify your [T shaped skills](https://jonathanboymal.substack.com/p/why-t-shaped-skills-matter-more-than).

**Choose thoughtfully, Act decisively.**

p.s I used to want to be a one man army. It had helped me of course to know **a bit** of everything, so I can cross relate things outside of my domain. But this didn't scale well.
