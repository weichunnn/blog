A follow up from yesterday's blog, I also want to pen down some criteria that I thought of when looking for a new job. This was something I discussed with my friends Abid and Jeremy while we are on a roadtrip.

In short, I boil it down to 4 criterias:

* **Having a lot of smart people in the team**. Having people who are ahead of you can serve as guidance and mentorship. These people are usually the one that you aspire to be, expert in their field or have so much experience that you just want to learn off them. 

  I am fortunate enough to have met some of these people at MoneyLion. If you are reading this, Abid, Jeremy, Arnold, Nazmi, thank you for shedding light on my short journey there. 

* **Idea/Industry**. I want to work on something that I am passionate about. And right now that's fintech or AI. These field is lucrative in itself but also difficult because there's so much regulation and competition. That's what makes it interesting. 

  Also because that's where the future of money is.

* **Location**. I love to travel and work at the same time. So being able to work in a remote country attracts me at this point in life. If I am older and planning to settle down, this point might change.

  Right now, those cities are San Francisco, Japan, and Hong Kong. Why? Strong culture and city life.

* **Compensation**. This is the least important to me (for now, if I have more commitments then I will move this up). I think if you are good at what you do, money will come. But I also understand that money is important to sustain a living. 

  I choose the job which will provide me a good enough compensation that I can save yet spend without constantly looking at the price tag (or contemplating my lifestyle choices).
