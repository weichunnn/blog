I thought about this today.

Whenever I purchase something, or try to make a decision, I take a very long time. And it's often not easy for me to be firm unless I have done a lot of research on it.

Most of the time, it's because I don't want to regret my decision, even for the smallest things.

Today, I spent quite some time finding the right water bottle - comparing multiple different brands and sizes and learning about the different types of materials used in water bottles. For example, I didn't know some types of thermos are not suited for hot water and are cold/warm water safe only.

I realized I use Reddit a lot to make decisions. I simply don't trust Google anymore with so many sponsored review content. Reddit is a place where I can find real people's opinions and experiences.

To simplify my life next time, I gave myself a rule next time to avoid this decision paralysis: If I have 2 options, and I can't decide, I'll just pick the second one. The reason is because you won't have second thoughts about the first one if it was right for you (so there must be something you are not satisfied with).
