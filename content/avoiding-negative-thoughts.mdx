On average, humans have about 60,000 thoughts per day. 

And according to the National Science Foundation, 80% of those thoughts are negative and 95% are repetitive thoughts.

This is true for me. Sometimes I find myself in a negative thought loop. I would think about something that happened in the past, and then I would think about what I could have done differently. This would lead to me feeling bad about myself.

I learned not to 'follow' every thought that arises. It helps me not overthink and ruminate. Whenever I catch myself doing it, I quickly switch to a positive thought, like my brain is watching a presentation and I can change the slide whenever I want.
