A couple of weeks ago, I bought my first iPhone, which is the base iPhone 15 in blue.

After weeks of using it, I finally understand why people are so into the ecosystem. Here are some of my reasons why I love it:

1. The camera is really good. Like REALLY good. I can take photos in low light, and they still look great. I also love the portrait mode and the night mode.
2. The AirPods' transition between devices is seamless.
3. Apps are generally better designed and more polished. I find more indie apps here as well.
4. Settings are self-explanatory and easy to navigate.
5. It no longer overheats when I'm using it for a long time.
6. Swiping gestures have improved my quality of life.
7. I can AirDrop from my phone to my laptop without going through Google Drive/WhatsApp.
8. It just works. The user experience is top-notch. Most of the time, I don't have to think about how to do something.

Living in an Asian household meant that I got hand-me-down phones throughout my childhood into my teenage years - it was really enough for me, so I didn't need to buy a brand-new one. I was also not really open to asking my parents to fork out additional money to purchase something that I could live without. I guess it's a mindset thing where I don't want to be a burden to my parents by getting things which weren't really necessary.

It was not until I got my first bonus check from MoneyLion that I decided: well, I can reward myself with a better phone now. It was also because I wanted to take better photos during trips and events.
