This question had always been lingering on my mind. I always wanted to build a startup,
but which idea could be the one? Here are some takeaways from my others' advice on
the same topic.

1. **If you want to make something grand, don't start with grand ambitions.** Start small and start writing ideas down, the more you do it, the more you have.

2. **Focus on repeat offenders.** These ideas are the ones that you keep thinking about, the one that you fall asleep to.

3. **Tell your friends.** This helps to validate your idea (or shut them down if they are bad). And with accountability as well.

4. **Make sure you enjoy thinking about it.** The more you think about it, the more experience you gain. And you slowly become the subject matter expert.

5. **Simplify.** As en engineer, we tend to overcomplicate things, because we think problems are complicated to start with and we want to make it 'scalable'. Instead, take a step back, and think about how you can simplify the problem. And thus the solution.

6. **Validate the market.** You can build a steller product, but if no one is using it, then it's only a product for your own satisfacation. Start talking to people when you are building. Even better, build in public.

7. **Launch uncomfortably quickly.** There's never too early to launch. You can always iterate and improve. But if you don't launch, you will never know if it's good enough.
