[Eminem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFYQQPAOz7Y), the unrefuted world's best rhymer, brainstormed via mindmap to write his lyrics. This surprised me today because I always thought he wrote in a linear way like a story similar to how songwriter write their songs.

Writing things down as it comes to your head is a really great way of just thinking and remembering, you can pull disparate ideas from yesterday to today's idea and connect them together. It's messy brain bump but it works.
