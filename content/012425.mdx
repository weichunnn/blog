Statquest's Joshua Stammer came to the school for a seminar today. It's so surreal to see someone that you've watched on YouTube during the whole of your undergrad in person.

He did all the things you expected him to do ie silly songs on the ukelele, BAMs, and the like. I also didn't know he was a professional cello player before he started Statquest. That's pretty cool. The reason he learned to play the cello was because his older brother picked the largest instrument for him to play.

I got Chipotle after that, but I was quite sad because the portion I got is so much lesser this time. I felt it because the bowl was lighter than usual. Is there a trick to getting your money's worth at Chipotle?

My friend shared me [this trick](https://matthewjcheung.medium.com/chipotle-ordering-secrets-e0afa5a1e79) where you ask for half and half and usually get more than 1 portion of the ingredient. I'll try that next time.

Also I didn't know you can technically get a free guacamole if you sign up for an account with a new email every time. I don't do that though because I don't really like avocados ðŸ¥‘.

Hung out with A later that night and we went to celebrate one of our classmate's birthday at an arcade bar. There's no entrance fee and you can play all the games with tokens. We played a lot of snookers, basketball, cornhole, air hockey, mario karts and then ended it with a game of foosball.

I'm not good at any of the games, but I really like arcades. It feels like childhood again, where I would have the chance to go to the arcade if my parents brings us to the mall. I would then be at the arcade while they shop around. I remember my favorite game was the one where you can [race another person in a car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL9tEBgFsHY) and also the game where you [play the drums.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiko_no_Tatsujin)
