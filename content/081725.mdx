went to grocery market today and bought a new monstera. it's the first big plant that I bought and they were on a cheap price - $12.99 for a huge one! on the way I was almost bitten by an unleashed dog so that's a memory.

i've been into plants lately - now caring a peace lily then an indoor evergreen shrub. looking at them grow made me happy and they made my place livelier than ever.
it's not hard to care for them as well, just need to make sure that you are watering adequately and they will thrive.
i also bought some houseplants fertilizer last night to give them an extra boost of nutrients. from my research, these are the good stuff:

- [foxfarm](https://www.amazon.com/FoxFarm-FX14002-Bloom-Liquid-Concentrate/dp/B0002KHDLW)
- [jack classic all purpose](https://www.amazon.com/Peters-Classic-20-20-20-Purpose-Fertilizer/dp/B005LKNCZY)
- [superthrive (dyna pro)](https://www.amazon.com/Foliage-Pro-oz-9-3-6-Plant-Food/dp/B01DFH00HW)
- [liquidirt](https://www.amazon.com/LiquiDirt-All-Purpose-Organic-Fertilizer-Balanced/dp/B07PHNQSP9)

i got [another brand](https://www.amazon.com/Food-All-purpose-Fertilizers-Plants-Pets/dp/B07QNMBLGQ/) because the good stuff comes in too big of a bottle. avoid miracle-gro since people say it doesn't provide the neccessary nutrients and is just the bare minimum. tends to burn the roots as well.
