title: ops as a service

spent the night thinking and got an idea for me to build. here's a brain dump:

combine [risotto ai](https://tryrisotto.com) and [ardent ai](https://www.ardentai.io), and focus on ops related things ie data ops (create new pipeline), ml ops (fixing bug on CI, adding new feature from DS into CI pipeline), dev ops (spinning up a new server / changing some rules on aws). i think all the keep the lights on task is very boring and automatable.
value is to remove distractions from day to day pings and even remove the need for daytime oncalls. challenge is to train on each company’s code practice. different from devin because some companies does some ops through changes on the UI (so no code). frontend would be slack and linear only.

it’s something that i see happening across companies i work with but never a priority because those teams don't utilize AI much
