1:1 are those 30 minutes of time where you sit in with your manager and talk. i used to be nervous about what to talk about but lately i think i'm getting better at it.
generally, people use it to give updates on project or ask advice. on top of that i like to use it to know more of what's happening around me - to get that additional piece of context.

some questions I like to ask:

- what are you thinking about?
- anything interesting that happened last week?
- what's your take on <something>?
- any feedbacks for me?
- what's something that you want to be solved?
