I went for my first health checkup at [Pantai Hospital](https://www.pantai.com.my/ms-my/kuala-lumpur) today.

It was an interesting experience, and I think this should be a yearly thing for everyone once they start working (most companies expense it anyway, so you should make use of it).

You learn so much about your body's health and what you can do to improve it from a simple screening. Besides that, they can also give you warning signs about potential health issues that you might have inherited from your parents.
For example, I learned that my iron intake is low and I should eat more spinach and red meat.

Fun fact! I learned that eating too much rice is bad for health as [it increases your glucose level and can lead to diabetes](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/eating-white-rice-regularly-may-raise-type-2-diabetes-risk/).
Coming from an Asian household who feast on **multiple bowls of rice a day**, it surprised me ðŸ¤¯.
