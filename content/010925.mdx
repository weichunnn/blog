Isn't it scary to forget things?

Today I finished studying up on Snowflake's as part of system design. Despite working with it for 2 years back then (before school), I feel that my knowledge on the topic had deteriorated a lot.

This time round while I was looking into docs, I felt like recapping on the basic. Things on optimization and best practices.

It's so important to keep revisitng topics to keep them fresh in memory. You might now need to memorise everything, but at least you know where to look for the information when you need it.

For me overtime, the table of content sticks to my brain and I can easily recall where to look for the information. It's like a mental map. Slowly connecting the dots.

I like to listen to instrumentals while studying. Some of my favorites:
