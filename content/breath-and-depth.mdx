Is it better to know a lot of things or know one thing really well?
I think this is a question that is always in our mind (or at least mine).

My opinion is that it's better to know a lot of things because they provide context, and context gives you the power to relate information together.
Especially in this world where everything is everywhere, it's hard to find people who know how big systems work.

With that said, I also think you should also be at least good in one thing. Being a technical expert on something gives you an edge in troubleshooting problems right down to the root level and provides you an avenue to make an impact. Most problems in the world are fixed by these people.

Some ways of reaching there:

1. **Follow curiosity** - read and read and read
2. **Follow great people** - mentorship is underated and people should take advantage of surrounding thenselves with 10x people.

A common analogy
