Vincent Van Gogh didn't consume yellow paint to bring himself joy; rather, he did so because he was feeling depressed and suicidal. On the other hand, he also didn't create "Starry Night" and his other great works out of depression; instead, he painted most of them during his recovery, aiming to convey the warmth and hope he felt for the world.

Celebrating Van Gogh should **involve recognizing his strength and resilience in battling his inner demons, rather than merely romanticizing his suffering**. This is what we human get wrong fairly often when viewing artists. We should focus on positive and growth (the uplifting aspect) rather than the negative and suffering (the tragic aspect).

Some of my favorite Van Gogh paintings:
