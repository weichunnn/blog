One work practice I have been using is to write before I start any discussion. It's simple yet people generally go into discussion without having thought through their entire argument. 

Writing helps to clarify your thoughts and also helps you to see the holes in your argument. I think it works because writing is a slow process - you have to physically think and then move your finger muscle to type each word. This slow process give you that thinking time between each idea.

I usually stay away debate which does not have a written discussion. It's usually a waste of time and does not lead to any conclusion. That's why meetings **MUST have a pre-read and an agenda**.
