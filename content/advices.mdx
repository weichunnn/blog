Sometimes I think that I am **not at that stage in life where I can give advices**. 

Every choice in life is not deterministic, the same thing that 2 person do will not yield the same outcome. Some people are just pure lucky at some times.

So most of the time, I would tell people to take my 'advice' or words with a grain of salt. **Take only what is applicable to you and leave the rest**. Explore the current context of the world before making a decision.

The general thing I hope to impart when I talk to juniors is to just take the **FIRST** step and **TRY**.
