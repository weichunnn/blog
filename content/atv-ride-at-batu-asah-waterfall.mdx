I went on a 1.5 hour ATV ride today at [Batu Asah waterfall near Kampung Kemensah](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/malaysia/selangor/air-terjun-batu-asah).

It was a fun experience. I was definitely a bit nervous at first, but I got the hang of it after a while.

We started off with a steep slope to get to the base camp, which was unexpectedly the thrill of the route,
since we didn't expect the most dangerous part to be at the start (due to the angle of ascent).

After the start, the route was a combination of flat trail with some hills to climb and some slopes that the ATV generally just slide down on (due to the mud being slippery so no gas is needed here).

Since the trail was already muddy, there were also some occasion when the mud flies from the side of the tires or the back tires of the ATV in front.
Some of us fell victim to this and learned to keep a distance after that.

My hands got sore about 1/2 way through the ride since I was playing with the brakes a lot of times. And the brakes were very stiff.

This is the waterfall we went to see, nestled right in the middle of the jungle. The water is cold and very refreshing. So it's definitely worth the trip.

After spending a little over 20 minutes there, we went back through similar routes to base camp and had lunch at a local indian banana leaf store.

It was definitely a fun expedition outside of the city and I would definitely do it again.

## Tips for others going on an ATV ride

### Notes

- **Don't speed and drift**, although it's tempting to do so. You don't get a seatbelt during the ride so it's easy to slide off the ATV when the road is bumpy
- Leave some space between the ATV in front of you, especially when going through muddy areas.
- Use the brakes sparingly to keep your hands from getting sore
  - Play with the front brakes when sliding down and the back brakes when going up
- Apply a ton of sunblock if you don't want to get sunburnt
  Go in the morning if it's possible

### Checklist of things to bring

- [ ] Small towel
- [ ] Cap
- [ ] Handsocks
- [ ] Change of clothes
- [ ] Slippers (for after the ride)
- [ ] Sunblock
- [ ] Mosquito repellent
- [ ] Water
- [ ] Ziplock bag for storing valuables
