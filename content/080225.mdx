life update today:

- I graduated from USFCA a month ago - my family came and it was one of the happiest time for me. We took a lot of pictures and travelled to lots of places together

- I started work at Retool
    - Got the call during my trip with fam at Disneyland
    - I joined a smaller team of 3 in DE
    - Workplace is quite fun with a lot of activities. There's a thriving club for both mahjong and poker 
    
- I moved to a new place. After 2 months of searching, I finally settled down in a nice studio in the Mission. I longed for a plce for myself so this is finally here.
    - I'm happy that I'm the first tenant so eveything is new. The building itself was completed this year
    - Selling things on Facebook Marketplace is tough (almost got threatened because a buyer had buyers' remorse)

- Paused working on InkLink and figuring out if we can raise pre-seed

- Sent off my close friends since they are moving OOS for work

- Bought a new plant and both are thriving now
