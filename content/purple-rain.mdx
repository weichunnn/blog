It is an experience listening to [Prince's Purple Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvnYmWpD_T8) while hiking up/down a hill. Imagine the wind blowing and the sun setting. It is really a moment of peace and tranquility. 

I woke up pretty early this morning at 6am and decided to go on a walk. It's not too far, around 30 minutes to [Coit Tower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvnYmWpD_T8). While staring at the Golden Gate, I listened to Purple Rain and the melody was just so soothing. I felt like I was in a movie, thinking about life and the past.

In his words, this was what he meant by Purple Rain

> When there's blood in the sky â€“ red and blue = purple... purple rain pertains to the end of the world and being with the one you love and letting your faith/god guide you through the purple rain.

A part of the lyrics goes like this:

> Purple rain, purple rain
> 
> Purple rain, purple rain
> 
> Purple rain, purple rain
> 
> I only want to see you underneath the purple 

I really like that walking is not hot and sweaty now compared to in KL. As long as the view or the companion is good, I think I can keep up with this morning walk everyday.
