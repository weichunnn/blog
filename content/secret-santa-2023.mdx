I participated in a Secret Santa event organized by my workplace this year. It was a fun experience, brainstorming gift ideas for my recipient and creating my own wishlist

I got these [candles](https://www.bathandbodyworks.com.my/rose-water-and-ivy-26291247/p/17468587) for my giftee since they were on her wishlist.

For me, my wishlist this year included:

- Anything scented, like perfume or candles.
- A book that you would recommend me reading.

And that's what I was gifted this year! It looks like Christmas will be a relaxing evening spent reading.
