It was 7am. I woke up tired from last night's event but was still up to bring my grandma to the hospital. It was her routine checkup day that happens every month or so.

We reached the hospital at 8:15am and opted for valet parking. Although slightly expensive, it was worth it as it meant that she didn't need to walk too far or climb the stairs.

We went to the registration counter and waited for our turn. I think the hospital could have employed a better system where elderly people are prioritized. Registration was fairly quick, then we went to the laboratory to get her blood test done. Even though it was early, it was already packed with people. The blood test was hard to do because her veins are not really visible, and they don't have enough flow. It took a couple of tries to get the blood out.

Once that was done, we had to wait for the results to come out, meaning another 2 hours of waiting before we could visit the doctors. The good thing is she prepared a wholesome fried rice for breakfast! I don't think anything beats a home-cooked meal. As I was eating, I saw a woman approaching me. Oh no. It was an insurance sales agent. I politely declined her offer since I already had one, but she insisted, and I had to listen to her for about an hour.

When our turn came, we went to the doctor's room. The doctors were all very friendly, and one even gave a fist bump! They conversed in Hokkien and Malay dialects since English is not her first language. The doctors checked her blood test report and body and said everything is fine. I was relieved. They also prescribed some medicine for some pain she was having.

Now at 1pm, it was another round of waiting to make the payment and collect the medicine. Medicines are expensive. I was hoping there were some subsidies for elderly people, but I didn't see any.

We went back home promptly after that.

Throughout the day, she explained that she had to go through this every month and it's tiring. Imagine getting your blood drawn every month. She also talked to me about what she did at home, and I think the time was well spent just listening to her and accompanying her.

I hope I can be there for her anytime she needs me.
