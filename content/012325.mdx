If I'm living alone, I would like to have a a dog as a companion.

And if I get to choose, it will be either a Shar-pei (because they look like a huge teddy bear) or a Golden Retriever. Mainly because they are calm and they are at a size which you can hug with your whole body.

p.s Is it just me or dog sizes in SF are either huge or tiny? It's never in between.
